## 2. Column definitions

| Column                                                     | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

# Outlier & High Variance Review Systems

## RSD (>20%) × Dixon (0.05) overlap — 2×2 cross-tab

Preview of the "candidate rule comparison" work planned for a later step; useful
now as a sanity check that the two methods are not simply redundant.

|                        | Dixon flagged | Dixon not flagged | Row total |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| **RSD>20 flagged**     | 19            | 152               | 171       |
| **RSD>20 not flagged** | 227           | 2314              | 2541      |
| **Column total**       | 246           | 2466              | 2712      |

Only 19 groups are flagged by both methods; each method independently flags a
substantial, largely non-overlapping set of additional groups (152 RSD-only, 227
Dixon-only). This indicates the two candidate rules are sensitive to different
failure patterns (RSD>20 flags overall spread regardless of shape; Dixon flags a
single extreme value relative to the group's range) and should be compared side
by side in later review rather than treated as interchangeable.

## ROUT placeholder

`rout_status == "not_calculated"` confirmed for all **2712/2712** rows.
`rout_status_reason` is populated from `analysis_config.ROUT_STATUS_REASON` on
every row.

**Current category distribution** (`precision_model_diagnostics.csv`,
regenerated with both fixes applied):

| Category                        | Count |
| ------------------------------- | ----: |
| `insufficient_data`             |    26 |
| `unclear`                       |    10 |
| `concentration_dependent_mixed` |    20 |
| `approx_constant_relative_RSD`  |    13 |

# Candidate Rule Comparison

## 1. Overall backlog generated by each screen

Across all 2712 replicate groups:

| Screen                     | Flagged | % of all 2712 groups | % of groups the screen could evaluate |
| -------------------------- | ------: | -------------------: | ------------------------------------: |
| RSD > 10%                  |     407 |                15.0% |           20.8% (of 1955 RSD-defined) |
| RSD > 20%                  |     177 |                 6.5% |            9.1% (of 1955 RSD-defined) |
| Dixon (α=0.05)             |     246 |                 9.1% |      17.0% (of 1447 Dixon-applicable) |
| 3×SD (pooled, exploratory) |      51 |                 1.9% |        2.6% (of 1966 3×SD-applicable) |

RSD > 10% produces by far the largest raw backlog (407 groups), followed by
Dixon (246), RSD > 20% (177), and 3×SD (51 — the smallest by a wide margin).

## 2. Dataset coverage / applicability of each screen

Not every method can be evaluated on every replicate group. Applicability (the
denominator each method actually had to work with) varies sharply:

| Screen                                    | Applicable groups | % of 2712 |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------: | --------: |
| RSD (defined, i.e. `RSD_percent` not NaN) |              1955 |     72.1% |
| Dixon (`dixon_status == "calculated"`)    |              1447 |     53.4% |
| 3×SD (`3xSD_status == "calculated"`)      |              1966 |     72.5% |

### Top individual `analysis_type × parameter` combinations by flag rate

**Highest RSD>20 flag rate** (among combinations with ≥5 RSD-defined groups):

| analysis_type | parameter | n_RSD_defined | % RSD>20 |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------: | -------: |
| xrf           | pr        |            18 |    44.4% |
| icp           | ti        |            14 |    42.9% |
| xrf           | mo        |            21 |    42.9% |
| xrf           | ce        |            23 |    39.1% |
| icp           | na        |            21 |    33.3% |

**Highest Dixon flag rate** (among combinations with ≥5 Dixon-applicable
groups):

| analysis_type | parameter | n_Dixon_applicable | % Dixon flagged |
| ------------- | --------- | -----------------: | --------------: |
| xrf           | rb        |                 37 |           75.7% |
| xrf           | sr        |                 39 |           56.4% |
| xrf           | u         |                 42 |           54.8% |
| xrf           | cu        |                 44 |           43.2% |
| compositional | arabinose |                  7 |           42.9% |

**Highest 3×SD flag rate** (among combinations with ≥10 3×SD-applicable groups):

| analysis_type | parameter | n_3xSD_applicable | % 3×SD flagged |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------------: | -------------: |
| xrf           | ca        |                45 |           6.7% |
| xrf           | la        |                18 |           5.6% |
| xrf           | sr        |                43 |           4.7% |
| compositional | glucose   |                66 |           4.5% |
| xrf           | si        |                45 |           4.4% |

The `xrf` analytical family dominates both the top RSD>20 and top Dixon
flag-rate lists, reinforcing the by-analysis-type finding that `xrf` carries a
disproportionate share of the review backlog for both methods. Dixon and 3×SD
flag rates are unaffected by the RSD sign fix (Dixon and 3×SD do not depend on
the sign of `RSD_percent`), so their top-5 lists above are numerically identical
to any earlier run.

---

## 5. Method semantics — what each screen is actually measuring

RSD identifies high replicate-group disagreement (relative to that group's own
mean); Dixon identifies an isolated within-group extreme value relative to the
rest of that same group; 3×SD compares each individual replicate value against
the _pooled, cross-group_ historical absolute replicate precision for that
`analysis_type × parameter` — a different, absolute-scale comparison rather than
a within-group relative one.

Concretely:

- **RSD** is a _relative, within-group_ statistic — it only uses that one
  replicate group's own values and mean.
- **Dixon** is also _within-group_ but tests a different question — whether the
  single most extreme value in that group is disproportionately far from its
  neighbors, regardless of the group's overall spread.
- **3×SD** is the only _cross-group, absolute-scale_ comparator here — it
  borrows a pooled SD estimated from every SD-defined replicate group sharing
  that `analysis_type × parameter`, then asks whether an individual value in
  _this_ group deviates more than 3× that pooled, historical absolute SD from
  this group's own mean.

Because these three methods answer genuinely different statistical questions,
the low three-way overlap in §3 (only 0.3% flagged by all three) is an expected
consequence of their differing semantics, not evidence that any one method is
"wrong."

---

## 6. 3×SD is exploratory only — not a proposed production threshold

The 3×SD comparator implemented in this step is **exploratory only** and is
**not** being proposed as a production QC threshold. It was computed purely to
give a third, absolute-scale point of comparison against RSD and Dixon.

Step 6A (`06a_build_precision_model_diagnostics.py` /
[`STEP6_FINDINGS.md`](STEP6_FINDINGS.md)) now finds 5 of 74 combinations
classified as `approx_constant_absolute_SD` (`compositional/xylan`,
`compositional/xylose`, `icp/si`, `xrf/k`, `proximate/volatile solids`) — a
small minority, giving only limited empirical support for an absolute-SD-based
precision model, the exact assumption a 3×SD-style threshold rests on, and only
for those specific parameters. The 3×SD comparator retained here remains
included purely for exploratory comparison against RSD/Dixon in this Step 8
table, not as an endorsement of absolute-SD thresholds as broadly appropriate
for this dataset.

---

## 1. Raw review backlog

Across all 2712 replicate groups, **427 (15.7%)** were flagged by at least one
of the three candidate screens (RSD > 20%, Dixon's Q at α = 0.05, or the
exploratory pooled 3×SD check) — this figure is reused as-is from
`candidate_rule_overlap_summary.csv`'s `flagged_by_any` row, not recomputed.
`outputs/flagged_review_queue.csv` contains exactly these 427 replicate groups,
one row each, with a `flag_category` column.

`flag_category` breakdown (validated to match
`candidate_rule_overlap_summary.csv` exactly, see §6 below):

| flag_category  |   Count | % of 427 |
| -------------- | ------: | -------: |
| Dixon_only     |     224 |    52.5% |
| RSD_only       |     140 |    32.8% |
| 3xSD_only      |      23 |     5.4% |
| RSD_and_3xSD   |      18 |     4.2% |
| RSD_and_Dixon  |      12 |     2.8% |
| all_three      |       7 |     1.6% |
| Dixon_and_3xSD |       3 |     0.7% |
| **Total**      | **427** | **100%** |

Dixon-only flags are the largest single category (52.5% of the queue),
consistent with Step 8's finding that Dixon most often fires on isolated extreme
values that RSD and the pooled 3×SD check do not also catch.

---

## 2. Where flags are concentrated

### Top analysis_type × parameter contributors

From `outputs/review_queue_by_analysis_parameter.csv` (one row per
`analysis_type × parameter` present in the queue, with both raw counts and flag
rates against the total replicate-group count for that combination, per the
guardrail against reporting counts without denominators):

| analysis_type | parameter       | n_flagged_groups | % of 427 | n_replicate_groups | flag_rate_percent |
| ------------- | --------------- | ---------------: | -------: | -----------------: | ----------------: |
| xrf           | rb              |               30 |     7.0% |                 52 |             57.7% |
| xrf           | cu              |               26 |     6.1% |                 55 |             47.3% |
| xrf           | sr              |               24 |     5.6% |                 54 |             44.4% |
| xrf           | u               |               23 |     5.4% |                 55 |             41.8% |
| proximate     | ash             |               21 |     4.9% |                115 |             18.3% |
| xrf           | k               |               15 |     3.5% |                 55 |             27.3% |
| proximate     | volatile solids |               14 |     3.3% |                115 |             12.2% |
| xrf           | mn              |               14 |     3.3% |                 55 |             25.5% |
| xrf           | zn              |               14 |     3.3% |                 55 |             25.5% |
| proximate     | total solids    |               13 |     3.0% |                115 |             11.3% |

**Top-5 combinations account for 29.0% of all 427 flags.** **Top-10 combinations
account for 45.4% of all 427 flags.**

The top contributors are dominated by `xrf` trace-element parameters (rb, cu,
sr, u, k, mn, zn) with very high flag _rates_ (42–58% of their own replicate
groups flagged) alongside high absolute counts — these are small denominators
(52–55 groups each) with unusually concentrated flagging, not just large
categories generating proportionally few flags.

### By analysis_type

| analysis_type | n_flagged_groups | % of 427 | n_replicate_groups (all) | flag_rate_percent |
| ------------- | ---------------: | -------: | -----------------------: | ----------------: |
| xrf           |              254 |    59.5% |                     1315 |             19.3% |
| icp           |               62 |    14.5% |                      518 |             12.0% |
| proximate     |               59 |    13.8% |                      460 |             12.8% |
| compositional |               52 |    12.2% |                      352 |             14.8% |

`xrf` contributes the majority of raw flags (59.5%) but its flag _rate_ (19.3%)
is not dramatically higher than the other three analysis types (12.0–14.8%) —
`xrf`'s dominance in raw counts is driven substantially by it having the largest
population (1315 of 2712 groups), not by a uniquely higher per-group flag
propensity.

### Clustering by experiment_id, resource_id, provider, sample preparation method, protocol_version

(counts AND rates, `dropna=False` throughout; full detail in
`outputs/review_queue_by_dimension_summary.csv`)

- **experiment_id**: 35 of 48 distinct experiment_ids appear in the flagged
  queue. **A single experiment_id (`47.0`) accounts for 59.5% of all 427 flags**
  (254 flags out of that experiment's own 925 replicate groups — a 27.5% flag
  rate for that experiment). Only 1 experiment_id is needed to reach ≥50% of all
  flags. `experiment_id=43.0` is the second largest, contributing another 14.3%
  (61 of 336 groups, 18.2% rate). See the baseline/enrichment table below for
  how these rates compare to the overall 15.7% baseline — experiment 47's rate
  is **elevated relative to baseline** (see correction below), not merely
  "similar."
- **resource_id**: 35 of 42 distinct resource_ids appear in the flagged queue; 7
  resource_ids account for ≥50% of the 427 flags. The single largest
  (`resource_id=25`) contributes 50 flags out of 311 replicate groups for that
  resource (16.1% rate) — near the dataset-wide 15.7% baseline, i.e. not an
  outlier rate despite being the top raw contributor.
- **provider**: 28 of 31 distinct providers appear in the flagged queue; 6
  providers account for ≥50% of flags. The single largest (`rigging`)
  contributes 55 flags out of 178 groups (30.9% rate) — meaningfully above the
  15.7% baseline, but still a minority of that provider's total groups.
- **sample preparation method**: 8 of 10 distinct sample preparation methods
  appear in the flagged queue; only 2 (`knife mill (2mm)` and
  `oven dry + knife mill (2mm)`) account for ≥50% of flags (197 and 144 flags
  respectively). `knife mill (2mm)`'s own flag rate (20.7% of its 952 groups) is
  close to baseline; `oven dry + knife mill (2mm)` is somewhat higher (24.4% of
  590 groups).
- **protocol_version**: 100% null across the entire 2712-row dataset (not just
  the flagged queue), so this dimension provides no discriminating information
  in the current data — every replicate group, flagged or not, has a missing
  `protocol_version`.

**Interpretation (descriptive, not causal):** raw flag counts are heavily
concentrated in a small number of experiments, resources, and providers simply
because those experiments/resources/providers contain many more replicate groups
overall — the corresponding flag _rates_ are, in most cases, close to the 15.7%
dataset-wide baseline. The `rigging` provider and `unused oak stick` resource
type (53.6% flag rate, footnote: only 28 total groups, a small denominator) are
the two dimension-values whose rates are most elevated relative to baseline. Per
the guardrail, none of this is interpreted as "this
provider/sample-preparation-method/resource is problematic" — only that review
workload is unevenly distributed and elevated rates on small denominators
warrant cautious interpretation.

# 3. Consolidation into investigation packets

## Chosen grouping key

`analysis_type + parameter + experiment_id`, evaluated with `dropna=False` so
that groups with a null `experiment_id` form their own explicit packet(s) rather
than being silently dropped.

**Documented limitation:** `experiment_id` is used here as a convenience
batching key. **The data does not establish that `experiment_id` corresponds to
a specific day/run/batch in a way that guarantees an analyst can investigate all
flagged groups within one experiment as a single coherent root-cause
investigation** — this is a provisional MVP simplification, not a validated
investigation unit.
