# BioCirV Replicate Precision & Outlier Assessment

## Purpose

This is a small, auditable, exploratory pipeline to characterize BioCirV
technical-replicate precision and compare candidate rerun / outlier flags (Level
1 technical-replicate variation only — the spread within one sample's replicate
cluster, as distinct from sample-to-sample or resource-to-resource variation).
It is not intended to choose or implement permanent production filters or
thresholds. See
[`biocirv_outlier_assessment_handoff_v4.md`](../biocirv_outlier_assessment_handoff_v4.md)
for the full task specification, statistical principles, and guardrails this
pipeline follows.

## Schema audit findings

Lightweight compatibility review (per the handoff's "Lightweight schema audit"
step) of whether each analysis type can be mapped to a shared
`sample × analysis × parameter × value` structure:

| Analysis type | Status        | Notes                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| compositional | COMPATIBLE    |                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| proximate     | COMPATIBLE    |                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| xrf           | COMPATIBLE    |                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| icp           | COMPATIBLE    |                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ultimate      | SMALL_MAPPING | Tiny n (≈78 rows). Includes non-elemental parameter names (e.g. `dm`, `adf-r`, `cf`) alongside nitrogen. Kept per the generic parameter/value principle rather than special-cased. |
| xrd           | COMPATIBLE    | Only 27 rows currently — low volume, watch for thin summaries downstream.                                                                                                          |
| calorimetry   | COMPATIBLE    | 0 rows currently — schema-ready, will populate as the DB grows.                                                                                                                    |

None of the seven target analyses required `DEFER`.

## Data source rationale

This pipeline extracts directly from the raw, unfiltered database rather than
reusing the filtered audit-target views in `audit/targets/views/*.py` (e.g.
`compositional.py`, `proximate.py`, `icp.py`). Those views apply business-rule
filtering — `qc_pass != 'fail'` row drops, compositional/ proximate sum-range
filters, an ICP max-ppm filter, and hard-coded resource exclusion lists — before
data reaches any downstream consumer. A replicate- precision and outlier study
needs to see exactly the rows those filters would hide, since
flagged/failed/edge-case rows are the population of interest here. See
[`extract_raw_data.py`](extract_raw_data.py) for the extraction query and a
fuller explanation in its docstring.

## No separate normalization step

The handoff doc's "Shared Normalization Layer" section originally envisioned a
dedicated `normalize_inputs.py` script to rename the raw SQL/DB-origin columns
produced by extraction into a canonical long-form schema. That extra stage
turned out to be unnecessary indirection: `observation`'s
`(parameter, value, unit)` structure already provides the structural
harmonization the normalization layer was meant to achieve across the seven
characterization analysis tables. Instead,
[`extract_raw_data.py`](extract_raw_data.py) aliases its SQL `SELECT` columns
directly to the canonical names, so its output CSV already is the canonical
schema — no separate `normalize_inputs.py` exists or is planned.

The canonical long-form columns produced directly by `extract_raw_data.py` are:

```text
record_id
sample_id
resource_id
resource_type
analysis_type
parameter
value
unit
lab
method
protocol_version
existing_QC_status
```

> **NOTE:** the normalized column `lab` actually contains provider / source
> codename values (e.g. "rigging"), not a laboratory identifier. The normalized
> column `method` actually contains sample preparation method values (e.g.
> "knife mill (2mm)"), not the analytical method. These are human-facing
> terminology clarifications only — the persisted column names (`lab`, `method`)
> are unchanged in Steps 1–8's own CSV outputs; Step 9 exposes human-readable
> aliases (`provider`, `sample_preparation_method`) in its own output files
> only.

plus a few extra columns kept for downstream convenience that are not part of
the strict canonical list: `experiment_id`, `technical_replicate_no`,
`technical_replicate_total`, `method_id`, `analyst_id`, `analyst_name`,
`analyst_email`, `note`, `created_at`.

Several of these are approximations given the current schema (documented in the
script's docstring/comments): `sample_id` is `prepared_sample_id` (closest DB
proxy to an independent sample), `lab` is `provider_codename` (no dedicated
"lab" field exists), `protocol_version` is `exper_start_date` (no dedicated
protocol_version column exists), and `existing_QC_status` is `qc_pass` carried
as metadata only — it is **not** used as a filter anywhere in this pipeline.

## Pipeline stages

Mirrors the handoff's "Suggested Structure," minus the now-unnecessary
`normalize_inputs.py` stage (see "No separate normalization step" above). Only
extraction exists today; everything else is TBD and will be added as separate,
incremental scripts.

### `outputs/precision_review_heatmap.png` — interpretation boundary

`05_build_review_heatmap.py` (Step 5) reads `method_parameter_summary.csv` as-is
— it performs no recomputation — and renders one compact heatmap with one row
per `analysis_type x parameter`. This heatmap is a **descriptive comparison
tool** for data coverage, typical/high-tail relative replicate precision
(RSD-based), and RSD/Dixon flagging rates across `analysis_type x parameter`
combinations. It must **NOT** be used to choose final QC thresholds, decide
absolute-SD-vs-relative-RSD precision models, or rank parameters by absolute SD
(units differ across parameters) — those are explicit human-review decisions per
the handoff's "Scientific Decisions After the MVP" section. Note in particular
that the heatmap's `median_SD` column is included only for reference and is
deliberately rendered with a flat, non-color-ranked background, since absolute
SD is reported in different physical units per parameter (e.g. % vs ppm) and is
not comparable across rows.

### `outputs/precision_model_heatmap.png` — interpretation boundary

`06b_build_precision_model_heatmap.py` (Step 6b) reads
`precision_model_diagnostics.csv` (built by
`06a_build_precision_model_diagnostics.py`) as-is — it performs no recomputation
— and renders one compact heatmap with one row per `analysis_type x parameter`.
This heatmap visualizes the comprehensive precision-model screen;
`precision_model_category` labels are exploratory, descriptive triage categories
based on simple log-log slope/R² heuristics — they are **NOT** validated
statistical models, **NOT** production QC rules, and must **NOT** be used to
automatically assign an absolute-SD-vs-relative-RSD precision model to any
parameter without human review. Categories and correlation values are for
identifying candidates worth closer visual inspection (see the 8 detailed
diagnostic plots planned for `outputs/plots_selected/`), not for making final
scientific determinations. Note that `precision_model_category` is rendered with
discrete/categorical coloring (not a continuous gradient), since it is a label
rather than a magnitude, and rows with `insufficient_data` naturally show
blank/gray cells in the correlation/slope columns (too few usable replicate
groups to compute them).

## Status

This is exploratory / MVP work per the handoff's guardrails. No production
thresholds, rerun policies, or database filters are being decided or implemented
here — outputs are intended to inform human review, not to drive automated
decisions.
