# Step 2 Findings — Sample-Level Summary

Script: [`02_build_sample_level_summary.py`](02_build_sample_level_summary.py)
Output: [`outputs/sample_level_summary.csv`](outputs/sample_level_summary.csv)

## What this table is

One row per `sample_id × analysis_type × parameter × unit × method` combination
— one level up from `replicate_group_summary.csv` (Step 1), which is keyed one
level further down by also including `experiment_id`. This collapses across
`experiment_id` when a sample was analyzed in more than one experimental run.

Two distinct variability statistics are reported side by side and must not be
confused:

- `pooled_SD` / `pooled_RSD_percent` — computed from ALL raw replicate values
  pooled together across every contributing experiment. Mixes within-experiment
  technical-replicate variation with between-experiment variation ("total
  variability" for the sample).
- `between_experiment_SD` / `between_experiment_RSD_percent` — computed only
  from the spread of the per-experiment group means (one value per contributing
  experiment, pulled from Step 1's `mean` column). Isolates inter-experiment
  agreement/disagreement and is only defined when
  `n_contributing_experiments > 1`.

## Key results

- **Total sample-level rows: 2561**
- **Rows spanning >1 experiment (`n_contributing_experiments > 1`): 151**
  (matches Step 0's confirmed count of 151 combinations that spanned more than
  one `experiment_id`)
- **Singleton pass-through rows (`n_contributing_experiments == 1`): 2410** —
  these rows' `pooled_SD`/`pooled_RSD_percent` are numerically identical to
  their single underlying Step 1 group's `standard_deviation`/ `RSD_percent`,
  and `between_experiment_SD`/`between_experiment_RSD_percent` are NaN
  (undefined with only one contributing experiment, as expected).

### Row counts by `analysis_type`

| analysis_type | n_rows   |
| ------------- | -------- |
| xrf           | 1315     |
| proximate     | 424      |
| icp           | 410      |
| compositional | 345      |
| ultimate      | 57       |
| xrd           | 10       |
| **TOTAL**     | **2561** |

(These are the WITHOUT-`experiment_id` group counts from Step 0's comparison
table — expected, since Step 2 deliberately collapses back across
`experiment_id`.)

### `pooled_RSD_percent`

- Undefined (NaN): 663 rows (25.9%) — undefined when `n_replicates == 1` across
  all contributing experiments, or when `sample_mean` is (near-)zero, per the
  same `RSD_MEAN_EPSILON = 1e-9` convention used in Step 1.
- Median (where defined): **3.38%**
- Median by `analysis_type`:

  | analysis_type | median pooled_RSD_percent |
  | ------------- | ------------------------- |
  | ultimate      | 0.00                      |
  | xrd           | 1.49                      |
  | compositional | 1.68                      |
  | proximate     | 1.74                      |
  | xrf           | 5.40                      |
  | icp           | 6.72                      |

  `icp` and `xrf` show visibly higher typical pooled RSD than the other
  characterization analyses — a candidate signal for later
  per-`analysis_type × parameter` review (Step 4+), not a conclusion in itself.

### `between_experiment_RSD_percent`

- Defined for exactly 151 rows (matches `n_contributing_experiments > 1` count
  above — by construction, undefined whenever only one experiment contributed).
- Median (where defined): **15.21%** — notably higher than the pooled-RSD median
  (3.38%), consistent with the expectation that inter-experiment disagreement is
  a materially different (and generally larger) source of variation than
  within-experiment technical-replicate spread. This is an observation for human
  review, not an automated conclusion (per handoff's "Core Statistical
  Principle" — Level 1 vs Level 2 variation must be kept separate).

## Reconciliation checks (from script's own validation output)

- `sum(n_replicates)` across all sample-level rows reconciles exactly against
  total raw rows (minus any excluded null-`sample_id` rows) — no double-counting
  or dropped rows.
- No metadata (`resource_id`/`resource_type`/`lab`/`protocol_version`)
  consistency warnings were unexpectedly high; any triggered warnings are logged
  by the script at runtime.

## Scope note

No filtering, flagging, or outlier logic is applied at this step — Step 2 is
purely a re-aggregation of Step 1's data to the sample level. Candidate flags
(RSD benchmarks, Dixon Q, ROUT placeholder) are added to
`replicate_group_summary.csv` in Step 3, not here.
