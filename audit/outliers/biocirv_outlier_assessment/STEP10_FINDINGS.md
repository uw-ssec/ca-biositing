# Step 10 Findings — Human-Review Priority Queue

Produced by [`10_build_review_priorities.py`](10_build_review_priorities.py),
reading `outputs/flagged_review_queue.csv` (427 rows),
`outputs/replicate_group_summary.csv` (2712 rows, all replicate groups, used for
denominators and `source_record_ids` traceability),
`outputs/review_queue_by_analysis_parameter.csv`,
`outputs/review_queue_by_dimension_summary.csv`, and
`outputs/investigation_packets.csv` (114 rows) — all produced by Steps 1–9 and
**not modified by this step**.

**Terminology note:** `flagged_review_queue.csv` (and this document) use the
Step-9-corrected human-readable names **provider** and **sample preparation
method** throughout (these columns are present verbatim in
`flagged_review_queue.csv`; the legacy `lab`/`method` names were not found
there). See [`STEP9_FINDINGS.md`](STEP9_FINDINGS.md) for the full
terminology-correction background.

**Throughout this document: a statistical flag is NOT a determination that the
underlying data is invalid, bad, or should be excluded.** This step identifies
where human review attention would be most efficiently spent given the existing
427-group backlog from Step 9 — it does not filter, delete, exclude, or
invalidate any observation. Every replicate group discussed below remains fully
present, unaltered, in `replicate_group_summary.csv`.

## 1. Input verification (performed before building on Step 9's outputs)

| Input file                               | Check                                    | Result                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `flagged_review_queue.csv`               | Row count == 427                         | **PASS** (427 rows)                                                                                                                                |
| `flagged_review_queue.csv`               | Column naming                            | `provider` / `sample_preparation_method` present (Step-9-corrected names); legacy `lab` / `method` **not** present in this file                    |
| `review_queue_by_analysis_parameter.csv` | Loads without error                      | **PASS** (50 rows; columns: `analysis_type`, `parameter`, `n_flagged_groups`, `percent_of_total_flags`, `n_replicate_groups`, `flag_rate_percent`) |
| `review_queue_by_dimension_summary.csv`  | Loads without error                      | **PASS** (116 rows; columns: `dimension`, `value`, `n_flagged_groups`, `percent_of_total_flags`, `n_replicate_groups_total`, `flag_rate_percent`)  |
| `investigation_packets.csv`              | Row count == 114                         | **PASS**                                                                                                                                           |
| `investigation_packets.csv`              | `sum(n_flagged_groups_in_packet) == 427` | **PASS**                                                                                                                                           |
| `replicate_group_summary.csv`            | Row count == 2712                        | **PASS**                                                                                                                                           |

All input-verification checks passed — no inconsistency was found in the Step 9
outputs this step depends on. `replicate_group_summary.csv` itself retains the
original upstream `lab`/`method` column headers (unchanged, as documented in
Step 9); `flagged_review_queue.csv` exposes the corrected
`provider`/`sample_preparation_method` names, which this document uses
consistently.

## 2. Review-target grain

Per the task scope, review targets below are built primarily at two grains:

- **`experiment_id`** (2 of the 7 selected priorities)
- **`analysis_type × parameter`** (5 of the 7 selected priorities)

`provider`, `resource_type`, `sample_preparation_method`, `flag_category`, and
`existing_QC_status` are used only as **supporting context** in the "why review"
text for each target below — none of these dimensions was promoted to a
standalone top-level target, because in every case examined
(`provider = rigging`, mixed `existing_QC_status` groups) the groups involved
were either too few (11 of 427 for mixed QC status) or almost entirely already
contained within an already-selected `experiment_id` target (`rigging`: 41 of
its 55 flagged groups fall inside `experiment_id = 47`) to justify a separate,
non-redundant top-level row.

As in Step 9, **`experiment_id` is retained here only as a convenient
review-grouping key** — this analysis does not establish that it corresponds to
a validated day/run/batch or a common-root-cause unit.

---

## 3. Human-review priority table

**Cumulative coverage note:** the "Cumulative % of 427 flagged groups addressed"
column is a true set-union calculation (see §4), not a naive sum of "Flagged
groups in target" — several of the `analysis_type × parameter` targets below
have **zero** overlap with each other and with the two `experiment_id` targets
by construction, but this was verified explicitly in code rather than assumed.

| Priority | Review target               | Grain                     | Flagged groups in target | Flag rate | Enrichment vs baseline | Cumulative % of 427 flagged groups addressed | Why review / suggested focus                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------: | --------------------------- | ------------------------- | -----------------------: | --------: | ---------------------: | -------------------------------------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|        1 | experiment_id = 47          | experiment_id             |                      254 |     27.5% |                  1.74x |                                        59.5% | Largest single target (59.5% of all flags), most elevated large-denominator flag rate in the dataset. Almost entirely `xrf` trace-element parameters (see §5 sub-focus list). Dixon_only-dominant flag-category mix. Provider `rigging` contributes 41/254 groups (context only). |
|        2 | experiment_id = 43          | experiment_id             |                       61 |     18.2% |                  1.15x |                                        73.8% | Second-largest experiment target, entirely `icp` trace-element parameters (see §5). RSD_only-dominant flag-category mix (53/61 = 87%) — a distinct signature from experiment 47's Dixon-dominant pattern. Includes 3 mixed-status (`fail,pass`) `icp/na` groups (context only).   |
|        3 | proximate x ash             | analysis_type x parameter |                       21 |     18.3% |                  1.16x |                                        78.7% | Largest `proximate` parameter target, zero overlap with experiment 47/43 (spread across many small experiments). Dixon_only-dominant (14/21). Includes 1 `fail` and 2 mixed-status groups — useful cross-check candidates.                                                        |
|        4 | proximate x volatile solids | analysis_type x parameter |                       14 |     12.2% |                  0.77x |                                        82.0% | Second `proximate` target, shares the mass-balance parameter family with `ash`; below-baseline rate but included for absolute count and family relationship.                                                                                                                      |
|        5 | compositional x xylan       | analysis_type x parameter |                       13 |     19.1% |                  1.21x |                                        85.0% | Largest `compositional` parameter target, spread across 9 distinct experiment_ids (27, 30, 31, 32, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40) — a genuinely different concentration pattern than the two experiment-level targets.                                                                       |
|        6 | proximate x total solids    | analysis_type x parameter |                       13 |     11.3% |                  0.72x |                                        88.1% | Third `proximate` target, same mass-balance family as `ash`/`volatile solids`; below-baseline rate, included for absolute count.                                                                                                                                                  |
|        7 | compositional x xylose      | analysis_type x parameter |                       11 |     16.7% |                  1.06x |                                        90.6% | Second `compositional` target, often measured alongside `xylan` in the same batch; grouped adjacently for reviewer convenience though it is a separate top-level target.                                                                                                          |

**Final cumulative unique coverage: 90.6%** of the 427 flagged groups (387 of
427 distinct `replicate_group_id`s) are addressed by these 7 priorities.

Full `replicate_group_id` and `source_record_ids` lists for every priority are
in `outputs/human_review_priorities.csv` (not reproduced in this table to keep
it readable).

---

## 4. How cumulative coverage was calculated

Each priority target (e.g. "experiment_id = 47", "proximate x ash") is first
materialized as an explicit Python `set` of `replicate_group_id` values drawn
from the 427-row `flagged_review_queue.csv`. Starting from an empty running set,
each successive priority's group-id set is combined into the running set with a
**set union** (`running_set = running_set | target_set`), and the reported
"Cumulative % of 427 flagged groups addressed" is `len(running_set) / 427 * 100`
at that point. Because set union automatically de-duplicates, any replicate
group that happens to belong to more than one selected target (for example, a
group could in principle belong to both an `experiment_id` target and an
`analysis_type × parameter` target) is only counted once toward the cumulative
percentage, rather than being double-counted by a naive running sum of "flagged
groups in target." In this particular selection, the five
`analysis_type × parameter` targets turned out to have zero overlap with the two
`experiment_id` targets and with each other (verified in code, not assumed) —
but the union-based calculation would have handled overlap correctly regardless.

## 5. Sub-focus notes for the largest experiment-level reviews

### Experiment 47 (254 flagged groups) — flags concentrated in `xrf` trace elements:

- `xrf/rb` — 30 groups
- `xrf/cu` — 26 groups
- `xrf/sr` — 24 groups
- `xrf/u` — 23 groups
- `xrf/k` — 15 groups
- `xrf/mn` — 14 groups
- `xrf/zn` — 14 groups
- `xrf/mo` — 12 groups
- `xrf/ba` — 12 groups
- `xrf/ca` — 11 groups

These 10 `xrf` parameters alone account for 181 of experiment 47's 254 flagged
groups (71%). Each of these parameters' flagged groups is **100% contained
within** experiment 47 (verified in code) — consistent with STEP9_FINDINGS.md's
identification of `xrf` trace-element parameters as the top individual
contributors to the overall 427-group backlog. They are listed here as
sub-focuses of the experiment_id = 47 priority rather than as separate top-level
rows, per the task's redundancy-avoidance guidance.

### Experiment 43 (61 flagged groups) — flags concentrated in `icp` trace elements:

- `icp/p` — 8 groups
- `icp/al` — 7 groups
- `icp/na` — 7 groups
- `icp/ti` — 6 groups
- `icp/cu` — 6 groups
- `icp/fe` — 5 groups
- `icp/si` — 5 groups
- `icp/nd` — 5 groups
- `icp/s` — 4 groups
- `icp/zn` — 3 groups

All 61 of experiment 43's flagged groups are `icp` parameters (no other analysis
type appears in this experiment's flagged rows), and its flag-category mix (87%
`RSD_only`) is notably different from experiment 47's Dixon-dominant pattern — a
potentially useful distinction for a reviewer prioritizing by likely flag
mechanism.

## 6. Reminder

**A statistical flag is not a determination that the underlying observation is
wrong, invalid, or should be excluded.** This priority list identifies where
human review attention would be most efficiently spent across the existing
427-group backlog — it is a working triage aid, not a data-quality verdict on
any individual replicate group, experiment, parameter, provider, or sample
preparation method named above.
