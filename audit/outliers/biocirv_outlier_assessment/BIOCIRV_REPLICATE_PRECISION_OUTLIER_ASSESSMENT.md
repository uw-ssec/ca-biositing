# BioCirV Exploratory Outlier & Variance Analysis Report

**Status:** Synthesis of a completed Exploratory Outlier & Variance Analysis
(Steps 0–10). This analysis summarizes and cross-references the existing, frozen
Step 0–10 outputs.

This document is a colleague-facing synthesis of the BioCirV **Exploratory
Outlier & Variance Analysis**, which investigated technical-replicate precision
and compared candidate outlier/high-variance screens across BioCirV's
characterization data. It is exploratory work intended to inform human review
and does not implement, recommend, or finalize any production QC threshold,
rerun policy, or database filter.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The analysis examined **2,712 technical-replicate groups** spanning six
characterization analysis families (`xrf`, `icp`, `proximate`, `compositional`,
`ultimate`, `xrd`) extracted from BioCirV's raw, unfiltered data. Its purpose
was to characterize how consistently repeated measurements of the same sample
agree with one another, and to compare several candidate statistical screens for
flagging replicate groups that show unusually large or unusual disagreement.

**Broad picture of replicate precision.** Typical (median) replicate precision
is good to excellent for most well-populated analysis families. See the
analysis-type precision table in Section 3 for the full quantitative breakdown.
Precision is not uniform: several `xrf` trace elements, several `icp` elements'
upper tails, and a handful of low-concentration/near-detection-limit
`compositional` sugars show materially higher typical or tail variability, and a
few analysis families (`ultimate`, `xrd`) have too little replicate data to draw
firm precision conclusions at all. Sparse data should not be read as "high
precision."

**Analysis families / parameters needing attention.** No single analysis family
is uniformly "poor." Specific `xrf` trace elements (rubidium, copper, strontium,
uranium, molybdenum, potassium, manganese, zinc, barium, cerium, praseodymium,
thorium) show flag rates several times the dataset-wide baseline. `icp` shows
reasonable median precision but extreme upper-tail RSD for elements including
titanium, neodymium, aluminum, and sodium. `proximate` ash shows a modestly
elevated flag rate; volatile solids and total solids contribute meaningful
review-queue counts despite flag rates _below_ the dataset-wide baseline (their
large denominators, not disproportionate unreliability, drive their raw counts).
`compositional` xylan and xylose are modestly elevated; arabinan/arabinose show
high enrichment but rest on very small samples (n=7).

**Review backlog.** Combining three candidate screens (RSD > 20%, Dixon's Q at α
= 0.05, and an exploratory pooled 3×SD comparator), **427 of 2,712 replicate
groups (15.7%) were flagged by at least one screen.** The three screens answer
different statistical questions and largely do not agree with one another — this
is expected, not evidence that any one screen is "wrong."

**Concentration of the review burden.** The 427-group backlog is highly
concentrated: a single `experiment_id` (47) accounts for 59.5% of all flags at
an elevated flag rate (27.5%, 1.74× the overall 15.7% baseline); a second
(`experiment_id` 43) adds another 14.3%. Five additional
`analysis_type × parameter` combinations bring cumulative, non-overlapping
coverage to **90.6%** of the entire 427-group backlog using only seven review
targets.

**A statistical flag is not proof of bad data.** Throughout this analysis, a
flag from RSD, Dixon, or the exploratory 3×SD comparator identifies a replicate
group **worth reviewing**. It does not, on its own, establish that any
individual measurement is erroneous, and it does not justify excluding or
deleting an observation.

## 2. Methods and Scope

### Scope of the Exploratory Outlier & Variance Analysis

This analysis focused exclusively on **characterization measurements** — `xrf`,
`icp`, `proximate`, `compositional`, `ultimate`, and `xrd` analyses of physical
samples/resources. It did **not** evaluate bioconversion or process-performance
data (e.g., biogas yield, digestion performance), which follows a fundamentally
different data shape and was out of scope from the outset.

A seventh characterization analysis, `calorimetry`, was scoped for potential
inclusion but currently has **0 rows** in the extracted dataset and therefore
contributes no findings here — it is schema-compatible and will be evaluated
once data exists.

The analysis used a **point-in-time extracted snapshot** of BioCirV's raw,
unfiltered database (`extract_raw_data.py` → `data/raw_extract_20260825.csv`,
6,155 rows), deliberately bypassing the pre-filtered audit-target views (which
drop `qc_pass == 'fail'` rows, apply compositional/proximate sum-range filters,
an ICP max-ppm filter, and hard-coded resource exclusions) because a
replicate-precision and outlier study needs to see exactly the rows those
filters would otherwise hide. This means the analysis reflects a snapshot, not a
live query — it is **not** wired into the production BioCirV database, and no
repeatable/automated pipeline against the staging or production database
currently exists. Building such a repeatable workflow (rerun on a schedule or on
demand against the staging database) is identified as future work, not something
already implemented.

### How the analysis activities built on each other

Steps 0–10 progressively built one shared, auditable pipeline. Script and output
filenames retain their original Step numbering for traceability; this table is
the one place in this report where Step numbers are used prominently.

## 3. Precision Findings

### What variability at different grains tells us

Replicate precision can be examined at several nested grains, and each answers a
different question:

- **Replicate group** — within-sample technical repeatability. Asks how
  consistently the _same physical sample_ is measured under the _same_
  analysis/parameter/preparation/experiment conditions. This is the finest grain
  and the primary unit of this analysis.
- **Independent sample** — distinguishes within-sample analytical variability
  from differences among separate physical samples. Between-sample variation can
  reflect genuine material heterogeneity (a real biological/physical property of
  the resource) and should not automatically be read as analytical error.
- **Analysis × parameter** — pools many replicate groups for one specific
  measurement (e.g., `xrf/rb`), characterizing what precision typically looks
  like for that measurement across the whole dataset.
- **Analysis type** — a higher-level view of whether precision concerns are
  broadly distributed across an entire analytical family (e.g., all of `xrf`) or
  concentrated in a handful of its parameters.

This matters because a bare statement like "SD = 3" is not inherently meaningful
in isolation — its significance depends on the parameter's units, its
concentration/value range, what precision is normally expected for that kind of
measurement, and whether replicate error for that parameter behaves more like
_constant absolute error_ or _constant relative error_ (addressed in Section 4).
It is equally important to keep the limits of this analysis in view:
between-sample or between-resource variability is not automatically measurement
error; a precision distribution describes a population of replicate groups, not
any single observation; and sparse replicate evidence (e.g., `n=1` groups, or
combinations with very few RSD-defined groups) cannot support strong precision
conclusions no matter how the summary statistic looks.

### Metrics used to characterize precision

The table below preserves the column definitions used throughout the Step 4
analysis × parameter summary (`outputs/method_parameter_summary.csv`). Not all
metrics are discussed in downstream tables. See the .csv for full findings.

Two qualifications carry through every table in this section: absolute SD
retains each parameter's own units and must not be compared across unrelated
parameters, and singleton (`n_replicates == 1`) groups have undefined SD/RSD by
construction. They were never coerced to zero.

### Precision by analysis type

The table below summarizes replicate-level RSD at the analysis-type grain,
computed directly from the 2,712 underlying replicate groups (not from averaging
per-parameter medians).

| Analysis type | Median RSD | Min RSD | Max RSD | P90 RSD | % RSD > 10 | % RSD > 20 | n replicate groups |
| ------------- | ---------: | ------: | ------: | ------: | ---------: | ---------: | -----------------: |
| xrf           |      5.40% |   0.00% | 161.40% |  20.23% |     30.30% |     10.53% |              1,315 |
| icp           |      2.89% |   0.00% | 682.75% |  31.43% |     26.59% |     17.17% |                518 |
| proximate     |      1.30% |   0.01% | 297.59% |   8.76% |      8.20% |      2.28% |                460 |

_Computed directly from `outputs/replicate_group_summary.csv`'s `RSD_percent`
column, grouped by `analysis_type` — i.e. pooling all RSD-defined replicate
groups for that analysis type and taking the median/min/max/P90/%>10/%>20 of
their individual RSD values, not by averaging the 74
per-`analysis_type × parameter` medians in `method_parameter_summary.csv`.
`n replicate groups` is the total replicate-group count for that analysis type
(1,315/518/460/352/57/10, summing to 2,712); the RSD-based columns are computed
only over the subset with a defined RSD (779/361/439/350/17/9 groups
respectively, summing to the dataset's 1,955 RSD-defined groups)._

| Proximate     | Generally strong                                           | Total solids, moisture, and volatile solids all run at very low median RSD (0.31–1.05%); ash is somewhat higher (4.40%). All four parameters are close to fully RSD-defined (81.7–100%).                                                                                                 | Ash's flag rate (18.3%, 1.16×) is modestly elevated; volatile solids and total solids contribute meaningful _counts_ to the review queue (14 and 13 groups) despite flag _rates below_ the 15.7% baseline (12.2%/0.77×, 11.3%/0.72×) — their large denominator (115 groups each), not disproportionate unreliability, drives their raw contribution.                                                   | ash (mild); note that VS/TS queue presence ≠ poor overall precision | Present proximate parameters as generally reliable; an ash-specific caveat is reasonable, but VS/TS should not inherit a caveat merely from queue-count presence. |
| XRF           | Highly heterogeneous                                       | Matrix/major elements (ca, k, p, s, si, th, zn) sit in a tight 2–6% median-RSD band; several trace elements (ba 16.4%, mg 16.2%, mo 15.7%, pr 15.2%, ce 12.3%) run much higher, consistent with expected behavior near detection limits.                                                 | XRF's analysis-type-level flag rate (19.3%, 1.23×) is only modestly above baseline — its 59.5% share of the raw 427-group queue is driven mainly by it being the largest analysis family (48.5% of all 2,712 groups), not by uniquely poor per-group precision. Specific parameters are, however, substantially more enriched (rb 3.66×, cu 3.00×, sr 2.82×, u 2.65×, mo 1.91×, k 1.73×, mn/zn 1.62×). | rb, cu, sr, u, mo, k, mn, zn, ba, ce, pr, th                        | Do not issue a blanket XRF caveat; reserve parameter-specific caveats for the enriched trace elements above.                                                      |
| ICP           | Reasonable at the median, long tails for specific elements | Most element median RSDs sit at 1.2–5.3%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | P90/P95 RSD "blow out" for several elements despite adequate coverage: `ti` (P90=P95=141.4%, 58.3% RSD-defined), `nd` (P90=57.8%, P95=130.1%, 100% RSD-defined). ICP also has **0% Dixon applicability dataset-wide** (n_replicates never reaches 3 under the current replicate design), so Dixon provides no signal for any ICP parameter.                                                            | ti, nd, al, na                                                      | Avoid a single universal ICP precision statement; median-only framing would hide the real upper-tail risk for these elements.                                     |
| Compositional | Strong for major sugars, weaker for trace sugars           | glucan, glucose, lignin, xylan, xylose all run tight (median RSD ~1–2%).                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | arabinan/arabinose run notably higher (~6.5% median RSD) and are the two lowest-concentration, lowest-n sugars (spans of ~0.03–4 vs. tens for glucan/xylan) — precision appears to degrade near detection limits, but n=7 for each is thin evidence. xylan/xylose show modestly elevated flag rates (1.21×, 1.06×).                                                                                    | arabinan, arabinose (sparse-evidence caveat), xylan/xylose (mild)   | Summarize typical strong precision for major sugars; flag arabinan/arabinose as sparse-evidence rather than firmly "imprecise."                                   |
| Ultimate      | Insufficient evidence, not "high precision"                | 57 total groups across the analysis type; several parameters (`carbon`, `oxygen`) have only 1 replicate group each; `dm` has only 1 of 13 groups RSD-defined (7.7%); `adf-r`/`cf` have 4 of 13 (30.8%); `nitrogen` has 5 of 14 (35.7%). Zero flags were raised across all of `ultimate`. | Zero flags reflects near-total structural inapplicability (too few multi-replicate groups), not demonstrated precision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | All ultimate parameters — sparse-evidence caveat                    | Present as "limited replicate evidence," never as "high precision," per the guardrail below.                                                                      |

🚩 **Flagged for further discussion:** Twelve `xrf` trace parameters (`ag`,
`bi`, `cd`, `cr`, `hg`, `nb`, `ni`, `sb`, `se`, `sn`, `v`, `w`) have
`percent_RSD_defined = 0%` because every replicate group for these parameters
currently has exactly one replicate. RSD/SD can never be computed for these
parameters without a change to the replicate design, independent of how much
additional sample volume is collected. Whether triplicate runs for these (and
for `icp`, where Dixon is entirely inapplicable) would be worth the added cost
is a design question for the team, not something this analysis can resolve.

### Precision by analysis × parameter

The characterization dataset spans **74 distinct `analysis_type × parameter`
combinations**. The table below is a representative subset, ordered by
contribution to the combined review backlog (the same 427-group union of
RSD>20/Dixon/3×SD flags used throughout this report), together with each
combination's flag rate and its enrichment relative to the dataset-wide 15.7%
baseline flag rate. The complete 74-row table appears in the Appendix (Section
10, Table A1).

🚩 **Flagged for further discussion:** The `xrf` trace elements with the highest
Dixon flag rates (rb, sr, u, cu) and the `icp` elements with the most extreme
upper-tail RSD (ti, nd, al, na) are strong candidates for additional replicate
collection and/or analyst review. Their signal is robust (adequate n, in most
cases fully RSD-defined), not a small-sample artifact, so it warrants attention
rather than dismissal as noise.

🚩 **Flagged for further discussion:** `compositional/arabinose` and `arabinan`
show the highest enrichment values in the entire 74-row table (2.72x and 1.82x)
but rest on only 7 replicate groups each. Before treating these as a genuine
precision concern, additional replicate data for these two low-concentration
sugars would materially strengthen (or weaken) the finding.

## 4. Relative vs. Absolute Error Behavior

### Why distinguish relative and absolute variability?

Two different questions can be asked about a replicate group's spread:

- **RSD / relative variability** — how large is replicate disagreement _relative
  to_ the magnitude of the measurement?
- **SD / absolute variability** — how large is replicate disagreement on the
  measurement's _absolute_ scale (its own units)?

The distinction matters because values near zero can produce very high RSD
despite modest absolute differences (a classic low-concentration artifact); some
measurements may have roughly constant absolute error across their whole
concentration range; others may have error that scales with concentration
(roughly constant relative error); and some show mixed or ambiguous behavior.
There is no reason to expect one universal error model (all-relative or
all-absolute) to fit every `analysis_type × parameter` combination in this
dataset — and the evidence below confirms it does not.

| What you see                     | Best interpretation                                         |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| SD flat; RSD decreases with mean | Absolute-SD-like                                            |
| SD rises with mean; RSD flat     | Relative/RSD-like                                           |
| Both strongly depend on mean     | Neither simple model fits                                   |
| Neither clearly depends on mean  | Could be either; possibly too little range/data             |
| High RSD mostly near zero        | Possible low-concentration artifact; inspect as absolute SD |

### Observed precision-model behavior

Each of the 74 `analysis_type × parameter` combinations was classified into one
of five categories using a log-log slope/R² heuristic on mean vs. SD,
corroborated by Spearman correlation (mean vs. SD, mean vs. RSD) rather than a
blanket R² gate:

| Category                            | Count | Named example(s)                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ----: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Insufficient data                   |    26 | `compositional/lignin+` (n=4 replicate groups, n_points_usable_for_loglog=4 — just below the MIN_N_FOR_LOGLOG=5 fitting threshold; no slope/R² could be computed, but this is the combination closest to being fittable in this category) |
| Unclear                             |    10 | `proximate/total solids` (largest n in category, R²=0.085, slope=−0.696)                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Concentration-dependent mixed       |    20 | `xrf/zn` (slope=0.529, R²=0.438, n=41 — representative)                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Approximately constant relative RSD |    13 | `icp/ca` (best of 13, R²=0.886, slope=1.056, n=30)                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Approximately constant absolute SD  |     5 | `compositional/xylan`, `compositional/xylose`, `icp/si`, `xrf/k`, `proximate/volatile solids` (best: `proximate/volatile solids`, n=115, slope=−0.091, R²=0.006, Spearman=−0.289)                                                         |

**Only a minority (5 of 74) of combinations clearly support a
constant-absolute-SD model.** The majority behave more like relative error (13),
mixed concentration-dependence (20), unclear behavior (10), or lack sufficient
replicate evidence to classify at all (26). This is a direct empirical caution
against assuming one universal absolute-SD or relative-RSD error model applies
dataset-wide. Review of absolute-SD graphs may reveal their flagging was due to
outliers or other graphical features that disproportionately impacted the
categorization defining parameters. Removal of outlier/erroneous data could also
change the slope and R² values enough to change classifications.

Four existing diagnostic figures (one representative example per non-trivial
category) are available for visual review. See the Appendix (Section 10) for
embedded images and captions. Each figure contains two side-by-side subplots
(mean vs. SD, mean vs. RSD), labels high-leverage points with their
`replicate_group_id`, and displays a title reading "PROPOSED
precision_model_category: {category}" together with the underlying log-log
slope/R² diagnostics and an explicit "not a validated statistical cutoff"
caveat.

🚩 **Flagged for further analysis:** Manually review of mixed and unclear
diagnostic plots before assigning an analysis × parameter to a relative- or
absolute-error model.

🚩 **Flagged for further analysis:** During visual diagnostic review, consider
noting unusually extreme RSD>20 / 3×SD points replicate-group IDs (labeled) so
conspicuous cases can be traced directly back to source records.

## 5. Candidate Outlier & High-Variance Screens

### What question does each screen ask?

- **RSD > 10% / RSD > 20%** — _Does this replicate group have unusually large
  overall disagreement relative to its own mean?_ RSD is a relative,
  within-group statistic; it only uses that one group's own values and mean.
- **Dixon's Q** — _Does one individual measurement appear unusually extreme
  relative to the other measurements in this same replicate group?_ Dixon is
  also within-group, but focuses on a single extreme value rather than the
  group's total spread. This is a genuinely different question from RSD.
- **3× pooled within-replicate SD (exploratory only)** — _Does an individual
  value deviate unusually far, on an absolute scale, relative to the historical
  within-replicate precision observed for this `analysis_type × parameter`?_
  This is the only _cross-group, absolute-scale_ comparator among the three; it
  borrows a pooled SD from every SD-defined replicate group sharing that
  combination. It is explicitly **exploratory only, not a proposed production
  threshold** given that most parameter x analysis combinations do not support
  absolute standard deviation constancy.

### Screen applicability and review burden

Not every screen can evaluate every replicate group; raw flag counts are
misleading without knowing each screen's own applicable denominator. **Note on
the shared RSD denominator:** RSD > 10% and RSD > 20% intentionally share the
same 1,955-group "applicable population" — both thresholds are two different
cutoffs applied to the _same_ underlying RSD-defined population (any group with
a computable RSD is applicable to both).

| Screen                     | Flagged (count) | % of all 2,712 groups |                             Applicable population | % of 2,712 for which screen is applicable | % of applicable population flagged |
| -------------------------- | --------------: | --------------------: | ------------------------------------------------: | ----------------------------------------: | ---------------------------------: |
| RSD > 10%                  |             407 |                 15.0% |                               1,955 (RSD-defined) |                                     72.1% |                              20.8% |
| RSD > 20%                  |             177 |                  6.5% | 1,955 (RSD-defined, same population as RSD > 10%) |                                     72.1% |                               9.1% |
| Dixon (α=0.05)             |             246 |                  9.1% |                          1,447 (Dixon-applicable) |                                     53.4% |                              17.0% |
| 3×SD (pooled, exploratory) |              51 |                  1.9% |                           1,966 (3×SD-applicable) |                                     72.5% |                               2.6% |

Dixon has **0% applicability across the entire `icp` analysis type** (518
groups) — `n_replicates` never reaches 3 for ICP under the current replicate
design, so Dixon cannot be evaluated for a single ICP replicate group,
independent of how much ICP data exists.

### Agreement and disagreement among screens

| Category                 | Count | % of 427 | % of 2,712 |
| ------------------------ | ----: | -------: | ---------: |
| Dixon only               |   224 |    52.5% |       8.3% |
| RSD20 only               |   140 |    32.8% |       5.2% |
| 3×SD only                |    23 |     5.4% |       0.8% |
| RSD20 + 3×SD (not Dixon) |    18 |     4.2% |       0.7% |
| RSD20 + Dixon (not 3×SD) |    12 |     2.8% |       0.4% |
| All three                |     7 |     1.6% |       0.3% |
| Dixon + 3×SD (not RSD20) |     3 |     0.7% |       0.1% |
| Flagged by any           |   427 |     100% |      15.7% |
| Flagged by none          | 2,285 |        — |      84.3% |

Only 7 groups (0.3% of 2,712) were flagged by all three methods simultaneously.
Genuine three-way agreement is rare. **Low overlap is expected because the
screens answer different statistical questions; it is not evidence that one
method is "wrong."**

Dixon-only is the single largest category, consistent with Dixon most often
firing on an isolated extreme value in an otherwise low-spread group, a pattern
RSD (overall group spread) and 3×SD (an absolute, cross-group threshold) do not
necessarily also catch.

**Connecting 3×SD back to Section 4:** the 3×SD comparator's implicit
assumption, that replicate error is well described by a constant absolute SD for
a given `analysis_type × parameter` , is only clearly supported for 5 of 74
combinations (Section 4). This gives limited empirical justification for
treating 3×SD as a broadly appropriate absolute-scale screening model; it
remains useful here purely as an exploratory point of comparison against RSD and
Dixon, not as a candidate production rule.

🚩 **Flagged for further discussion:** Which signal or combination of signals
should eventually trigger routine analyst review?

## 6. Review Backlog and Investigation Prioritization

### Size and composition of the review backlog

**427 of 2,712 replicate groups (15.7%) were flagged by at least one of RSD>20,
Dixon, or the exploratory 3×SD screen.** The flag-category breakdown (Section 5)
shows Dixon-only as the largest single category (52.5% of the queue), RSD-only
second (32.8%), and all pairwise/triple combinations together making up the
remaining ~15%.

### Where flags are concentrated

See [Precision by analysis × parameter](#precision-by-analysis--parameter) above
for the full per-combination and per-analysis-type breakdown (flagged counts,
flag rates, and enrichment vs. the 15.7% baseline); this section focuses on
cross-cutting concentration patterns not already covered there — experiment_id,
provider, sample preparation method, and existing QC status.

**Other review dimensions** The table below merges the Step 10 priority-order
targets (rows 1–7, which achieve 90.6% true set-union cumulative coverage of the
427-group backlog) with additional Step 9 supporting-context dimension cuts
(rows 8–11, not promoted to standalone Step 10 targets because they are
redundant with or subsumed by an already-selected target).

Rows 1–7 use true set-union cumulative coverage (verified zero overlap between
the five analysis × parameter rows and the two experiment_id rows) so the final
90.6% is not double-counted. Rows 8–11 are non unique: `xrf` overlaps heavily
with experiment 47's own sub-focus list; the `rigging` provider is already
41-of-254 inside the experiment 47 target and so was not made a separate row;
`provider` and `sample_preparation_method` were considered but rejected as
standalone Step 10 targets for being redundant with, or too small relative to,
the selected targets.

**Experiment 47 sub-focus** (254 groups): `xrf/rb`=30, `cu`=26, `sr`=24, `u`=23,
`k`=15, `mn`=14, `zn`=14, `mo`=12, `ba`=12, `ca`=11 — these 10 parameters make
up 181/254 (71%) of experiment 47's flags, each 100% contained within experiment
47, with a Dixon_only-dominant flag-category mix.

**Experiment 43 sub-focus** (61 groups): `icp/p`=8, `al`=7, `na`=7, `ti`=6,
`cu`=6, `fe`=5, `si`=5, `nd`=5, `s`=4, `zn`=3 — all 61 flagged groups are `icp`,
with an RSD_only-dominant mix (87%), a notably different signature from
experiment 47's Dixon-dominant pattern.

**`existing_QC_status` overlap** (descriptive only):

| existing_QC_status | n_flagged | % of 427 | n_total | flag_rate |
| ------------------ | --------: | -------: | ------: | --------: |
| pass               |       390 |    91.3% |   1,994 |     19.6% |
| (missing)          |        14 |     3.3% |      83 |     16.9% |
| fail               |        12 |     2.8% |     233 |      5.2% |
| fail,pass          |         7 |     1.6% |       8 |     87.5% |
| pass,provisional   |         4 |     0.9% |       4 |    100.0% |

Values such as `fail,pass` and `pass,provisional` are **mixed within replicate
group QC statuses**, comma-joined distinct statuses observed across the
underlying records of that one replicate group, not standalone QC categories.
Their apparently striking 87.5%/100.0% flag rates rest on tiny denominators (8
and 4 groups) and are better read as a small number of interesting candidates
for direct human review than as strong statistical evidence. Groups already
marked `fail` are actually flagged at a _lower_ rate (5.2%) than the dataset
average (15.7%). This may be due to other reasons than variance being cause of
QC fail statu, showing statistical screening and existing QC do not simply
reproduce one another.

### Consolidating cases into investigations

The provisional grouping key `analysis_type + parameter + experiment_id` was
chosen after comparing several alternatives:

| grouping_key                                 | n_packets | median_group_size | max_group_size | n_singleton_packets | % singleton |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------: | ----------------: | -------------: | ------------------: | ----------: |
| base (analysis_type+parameter+experiment_id) |       114 |               2.0 |             30 |                  53 |       46.5% |
| +resource_id                                 |       340 |               1.0 |              5 |                 273 |       80.3% |
| +provider                                    |       297 |               1.0 |              6 |                 211 |       71.0% |
| +sample_preparation_method                   |       144 |               2.0 |             18 |                  69 |       47.9% |
| all metadata dims combined                   |       379 |               1.0 |              4 |                 338 |       89.2% |

Adding more metadata dimensions rapidly fragments the backlog into mostly
singleton packets, defeating the purpose of consolidation.

**Documented limitation, preserved as-is:** `experiment_id` is a convenient
review-grouping key. The available data do **not** establish that it corresponds
to a specific common day/run/batch or a validated shared root cause. It is a
provisional simplification for organizing review, not a proven investigation
unit.

### Human-review priorities

The merged priority table above ("Other review dimensions") key practical
finding is that **seven non-overlapping review targets (2 `experiment_id`s and 5
`analysis_type × parameter` combinations) collectively address 90.6% of the
entire 427-group backlog** (387 of 427 unique replicate groups), calculated such
that any group belonging to more than one target would be counted only once.
This means a small number of coherent investigations can, in principle, address
most of the backlog.

🚩 **Flagged for further discussion:** Is
`analysis_type + parameter + experiment_id` actually a useful investigation
grain for the analysts who will conduct review?

🚩 **Flagged for further discussion:** What is a reasonable analyst review load?
The answer depends not only on case count but on how much friction the review
interface and documentation workflow create.

## 7. Report Summary for Analysts

**Different flags imply different review questions.** A high RSD flag calls for
investigating large _overall_ replicate disagreement within a group. A Dixon
flag calls for investigating whether a single, potentially isolated extreme
replicate is responsible for that group's spread. A 3×SD flag calls for
investigating an unusual _absolute_ deviation relative to the historical
within-replicate precision for that analysis × parameter, but remember 3xSD
comparator's exploratory status and its limited empirical support (only 5 of 74
combinations behave like constant-absolute-SD; Section 4).

**Flags need contextual review.** A statistical flag alone is not enough
information to disposition a case. An analyst reviewing a flagged replicate
group will typically need the individual replicate values, source record IDs,
existing QC status/notes, experiment context, resource/sample context, and
relevant preparation/method metadata together in one place. This report does not
prescribe a specific interface to do this, only that the flag by itself is
insufficient.

**Existing QC and statistical screening are complementary, not redundant.** The
large majority of statistically flagged groups (91.3%) already carry an
`existing_QC_status` of `pass`. This does not mean existing QC was wrong; it
means statistical screening surfaces forms of replicate disagreement that the
existing QC field does not currently represent.

**Investigation grain remains provisional.** The
`analysis_type + parameter + experiment_id` packet structure used to consolidate
427 flagged groups into 114 investigation packets may be useful, but remains an
unruly workload. Some experimentation may be required to determine the most
efficient way to select, evaluate and mark-as-analysis-ready swaths of data.

🚩 **Flagged for further discussion:** Is the proposed investigation-packet
grain useful to analysts?

🚩 **Flagged for further discussion:** What information must be visible together
in an analyst-review interface to make disposition fast and credible?

🚩 **Flagged for further discussion:** What recurring review workload is
operationally acceptable?

## 8. Report Summary for Frontend Data Visualization

Frontend communication of precision/variability findings should remain clearly
distinct from backend statistical QC screening. **A statistical flag should not
be displayed to end users as "bad data."** Instead, these findings can inform
how BioCirV communicates expected precision, parameter-specific variability,
evidence sufficiency, and relevant methodological context.

| Finding in analysis                                 | Possible frontend treatment                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Typical precision well characterized                | Ordinary presentation; precision context/metadata if useful             |
| Parameter shows elevated or long-tailed variability | Parameter-specific variability caveat                                   |
| Sparse replicate evidence                           | Indicate limited precision evidence rather than implying high precision |
| Relevant methodological/preparation differences     | Provide methodological context where useful                             |
| Individual statistical flag                         | Backend review signal; do not automatically label as bad data           |

**XRF.** XRF warrants substantial parameter-specific consideration, but not a
blanket warning — its overall flag rate (19.3%) is only modestly above baseline.
Emphasis should fall on specific elevated-enrichment parameters (rb, cu, sr, u,
mo, k, mn, zn, and others identified in Section 3), not on XRF as a whole.

**ICP.** Typical median precision is reasonable for most ICP elements, but
several show important upper-tail variability (ti, nd, al, na) that a single,
universal ICP precision statement would obscure. Frontend messaging should avoid
collapsing ICP into one precision claim.

**Proximate.** Several major parameters (total solids, moisture, volatile
solids) show strong typical repeatability while still contributing flagged cases
driven substantially by dataset size rather than poor reliability. Presence in
the human-review queue should not be equated with poor user-facing reliability
for these parameters; ash carries a more warranted, though still modest, caveat.

**Compositional.** Major structural sugars (glucan, glucose, lignin, xylan,
xylose) show strong typical precision; arabinan and arabinose are the exception,
showing higher variability that likely reflects proximity to detection limits,
but on only 7 replicate groups each. A sparse-evidence caveat is more
appropriate than a firm "high variability" claim.

**Sparse evidence.** For `ultimate`, `xrd`, and other sparsely replicated
measurements, the frontend (and any internal messaging) should distinguish
"limited evidence about precision" from "high precision". The current zero-flag
result for these analyses reflects insufficient multi-replicate data to
evaluate, not demonstrated reliability.

🚩 **Flagged for further discussion:** Which precision/variability information
is useful to BioCirV users versus appropriate only for internal QC?

🚩 **Flagged for further discussion:** Should frontend caveats be defined at the
analysis level, analysis × parameter level, or only after analyst disposition of
individual cases?

🚩 **Flagged for further discussion:** How should insufficient replicate
evidence be represented so absence of evidence is not mistaken for evidence of
high precision?

## 9. Data Quality Due Diligence Questions for Further Discussion

This Exploratory Outlier & Variance Analysis demonstrates that BioCirV can
quantify replicate precision at measurement-specific grains; that different
statistical signals identify complementary, largely non-redundant review
candidates; that the resulting review burden is measurable (427 of 2,712 groups,
15.7%); that this burden is concentrated enough to prioritize a small number of
coherent investigations (90.6% coverage from seven targets); and that none of
these statistical signals, independently, proves that any observation is
erroneous.

**Proposed Data Quality Due Diligence principle** (proposed only — not a claim
that production infrastructure already implements it): _BioCirV preserves raw
observations, screens analysis-ready data for predefined quality signals, and
uses flagged cases to prioritize documented human review. Statistical flags
initiate due diligence; they do not independently establish that a measurement
is erroneous or justify deletion._

Relevant unresolved decisions intentionally not settled in this report include:
which signals should trigger review; what evidence analysts should inspect for
disposition; what constitutes sufficient disposition/documentation; what review
burden is operationally acceptable; and which findings should remain
backend-only versus become frontend-facing context.

🚩 **Flagged for further discussion:** What exactly should a BioCirV "Data
Quality Due Diligence Guarantee" promise?

Key cross-checks: volatile solids and total solids are both below baseline
(0.77×, 0.72×) despite meaningful absolute counts (14, 13), driven by their
shared large denominator (115 groups). The highest single enrichment values in
the table are `compositional/arabinose` (2.72×, n=7 — small-denominator caveat
applies) and `xrf/rb` (3.66×, n=52 — a robust denominator).

ICP median RSDs mostly sit at 1.2–5.3% (see Table A1), but P90/P95 blow out for
the `ti`/`nd` rows above despite adequate coverage.

### Figure catalog

All paths are relative to `audit/outliers/biocirv_outlier_assessment/` (this
report's own directory).

**Descriptive coverage/precision heatmap** — one row per
`analysis_type × parameter`, showing data coverage and RSD/Dixon flagging rates.
Not for choosing QC thresholds or ranking parameters by absolute SD; the
`median_SD` column is deliberately non-color-ranked since absolute SD units
differ by parameter.

![Precision review heatmap](outputs/precision_review_heatmap.png)

**Precision-model category heatmap** — one row per `analysis_type × parameter`,
showing the discrete `precision_model_category` label. `insufficient_data` rows
show blank/gray cells. These are exploratory triage categories, not validated
statistical models or production QC rules.

![Precision model heatmap](outputs/precision_model_heatmap.png)

**Selected diagnostic plots** (one representative example per non-trivial
`precision_model_category`; each contains two side-by-side subplots — mean vs.
SD, mean vs. RSD — with high-leverage points labeled by `replicate_group_id`, a
"PROPOSED precision_model_category" title, and log-log slope/R² diagnostics with
a "not a validated statistical cutoff" caveat):
