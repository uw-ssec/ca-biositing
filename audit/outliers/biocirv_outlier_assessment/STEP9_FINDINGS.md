# Step 9 Findings — Review-Queue / Workload Analysis

Produced by [`09_build_review_queue.py`](09_build_review_queue.py) and
[`09b_analyze_backlog_concentration.py`](09b_analyze_backlog_concentration.py),
reading `outputs/replicate_group_summary.csv` (2712 rows),
`outputs/replicate_group_3xSD_flags.csv` (2712 rows),
`outputs/candidate_rule_overlap_summary.csv`, and
`outputs/candidate_rule_comparison.csv` — all produced by Steps 1–8 and **not
modified by this step**.

**Terminology note:** the upstream normalized columns `lab` and `method` (as
they appear verbatim in Steps 1–8's own CSVs) are semantically mislabeled. `lab`
actually holds **provider / source codename** values (e.g. "rigging"), not a
laboratory identifier. `method` actually holds **sample preparation method**
values (e.g. "knife mill (2mm)"), not an analytical method. This document — and
Step 9's own CSV outputs (`flagged_review_queue.csv`,
`review_queue_by_dimension_summary.csv`, `investigation_packets.csv`) — use the
corrected human-readable names **provider** and **sample preparation method**
throughout. The underlying Steps 1–8 CSV column headers (`lab`, `method`) are
unchanged; only the human-facing labeling here and in Step 9's own outputs was
corrected.

**Throughout this document: a statistical flag is NOT a determination that the
underlying data is invalid, bad, or should be excluded.** This step measures
review burden and organizes investigation only. It does not filter, delete,
exclude, or invalidate any observation. Every replicate group discussed below
remains fully present, unaltered, in `replicate_group_summary.csv`.

## 1. Raw review backlog

Across all 2712 replicate groups, **427 (15.7%)** were flagged by at least one
of the three candidate screens (RSD > 20%, Dixon's Q at α = 0.05, or the
exploratory pooled 3×SD check) — this figure is reused as-is from
`candidate_rule_overlap_summary.csv`'s `flagged_by_any` row, not recomputed.
`outputs/flagged_review_queue.csv` contains exactly these 427 replicate groups,
one row each, with a `flag_category` column.

`flag_category` breakdown (validated to match
`candidate_rule_overlap_summary.csv` exactly, see §6 below):

| flag_category  |   Count | % of 427 |
| -------------- | ------: | -------: |
| Dixon_only     |     224 |    52.5% |
| RSD_only       |     140 |    32.8% |
| 3xSD_only      |      23 |     5.4% |
| RSD_and_3xSD   |      18 |     4.2% |
| RSD_and_Dixon  |      12 |     2.8% |
| all_three      |       7 |     1.6% |
| Dixon_and_3xSD |       3 |     0.7% |
| **Total**      | **427** | **100%** |

Dixon-only flags are the largest single category (52.5% of the queue),
consistent with Step 8's finding that Dixon most often fires on isolated extreme
values that RSD and the pooled 3×SD check do not also catch.

## 2. Where flags are concentrated

### Top analysis_type × parameter contributors

From `outputs/review_queue_by_analysis_parameter.csv` (one row per
`analysis_type × parameter` present in the queue, with both raw counts and flag
rates against the total replicate-group count for that combination, per the
guardrail against reporting counts without denominators):

| analysis_type | parameter       | n_flagged_groups | % of 427 | n_replicate_groups | flag_rate_percent |
| ------------- | --------------- | ---------------: | -------: | -----------------: | ----------------: |
| xrf           | rb              |               30 |     7.0% |                 52 |             57.7% |
| xrf           | cu              |               26 |     6.1% |                 55 |             47.3% |
| xrf           | sr              |               24 |     5.6% |                 54 |             44.4% |
| xrf           | u               |               23 |     5.4% |                 55 |             41.8% |
| proximate     | ash             |               21 |     4.9% |                115 |             18.3% |
| xrf           | k               |               15 |     3.5% |                 55 |             27.3% |
| proximate     | volatile solids |               14 |     3.3% |                115 |             12.2% |
| xrf           | mn              |               14 |     3.3% |                 55 |             25.5% |
| xrf           | zn              |               14 |     3.3% |                 55 |             25.5% |
| proximate     | total solids    |               13 |     3.0% |                115 |             11.3% |

**Top-5 combinations account for 29.0% of all 427 flags.** **Top-10 combinations
account for 45.4% of all 427 flags.**

The top contributors are dominated by `xrf` trace-element parameters (rb, cu,
sr, u, k, mn, zn) with very high flag _rates_ (42–58% of their own replicate
groups flagged) alongside high absolute counts — these are small denominators
(52–55 groups each) with unusually concentrated flagging, not just large
categories generating proportionally few flags.

### By analysis_type

| analysis_type | n_flagged_groups | % of 427 | n_replicate_groups (all) | flag_rate_percent |
| ------------- | ---------------: | -------: | -----------------------: | ----------------: |
| xrf           |              254 |    59.5% |                     1315 |             19.3% |
| icp           |               62 |    14.5% |                      518 |             12.0% |
| proximate     |               59 |    13.8% |                      460 |             12.8% |
| compositional |               52 |    12.2% |                      352 |             14.8% |

`xrf` contributes the majority of raw flags (59.5%) but its flag _rate_ (19.3%)
is not dramatically higher than the other three analysis types (12.0–14.8%) —
`xrf`'s dominance in raw counts is driven substantially by it having the largest
population (1315 of 2712 groups), not by a uniquely higher per-group flag
propensity.

### Clustering by experiment_id, resource_id, provider, sample preparation method, protocol_version

(counts AND rates, `dropna=False` throughout; full detail in
`outputs/review_queue_by_dimension_summary.csv`)

- **experiment_id**: 35 of 48 distinct experiment_ids appear in the flagged
  queue. **A single experiment_id (`47.0`) accounts for 59.5% of all 427 flags**
  (254 flags out of that experiment's own 925 replicate groups — a 27.5% flag
  rate for that experiment). Only 1 experiment_id is needed to reach ≥50% of all
  flags. `experiment_id=43.0` is the second largest, contributing another 14.3%
  (61 of 336 groups, 18.2% rate). See the baseline/enrichment table below for
  how these rates compare to the overall 15.7% baseline — experiment 47's rate
  is **elevated relative to baseline** (see correction below), not merely
  "similar."
- **resource_id**: 35 of 42 distinct resource_ids appear in the flagged queue; 7
  resource_ids account for ≥50% of the 427 flags. The single largest
  (`resource_id=25`) contributes 50 flags out of 311 replicate groups for that
  resource (16.1% rate) — near the dataset-wide 15.7% baseline, i.e. not an
  outlier rate despite being the top raw contributor.
- **provider**: 28 of 31 distinct providers appear in the flagged queue; 6
  providers account for ≥50% of flags. The single largest (`rigging`)
  contributes 55 flags out of 178 groups (30.9% rate) — meaningfully above the
  15.7% baseline, but still a minority of that provider's total groups.
- **sample preparation method**: 8 of 10 distinct sample preparation methods
  appear in the flagged queue; only 2 (`knife mill (2mm)` and
  `oven dry + knife mill (2mm)`) account for ≥50% of flags (197 and 144 flags
  respectively). `knife mill (2mm)`'s own flag rate (20.7% of its 952 groups) is
  close to baseline; `oven dry + knife mill (2mm)` is somewhat higher (24.4% of
  590 groups).
- **protocol_version**: 100% null across the entire 2712-row dataset (not just
  the flagged queue), so this dimension provides no discriminating information
  in the current data — every replicate group, flagged or not, has a missing
  `protocol_version`.

**Interpretation (descriptive, not causal):** raw flag counts are heavily
concentrated in a small number of experiments, resources, and providers simply
because those experiments/resources/providers contain many more replicate groups
overall — the corresponding flag _rates_ are, in most cases, close to the 15.7%
dataset-wide baseline. The `rigging` provider and `unused oak stick` resource
type (53.6% flag rate, footnote: only 28 total groups, a small denominator) are
the two dimension-values whose rates are most elevated relative to baseline. Per
the guardrail, none of this is interpreted as "this
provider/sample-preparation-method/resource is problematic" — only that review
workload is unevenly distributed and elevated rates on small denominators
warrant cautious interpretation.

### Baseline / enrichment comparison

The table above (and the by-analysis_type / by-provider / by-method breakdowns)
report **% of flagged groups** — i.e., where the 427-group review workload is
concentrated. That is a different question from **whether a given grouping is
flagged more often than its share of the dataset would suggest**. The table
below makes that second, "enrichment" question explicit for the handful of
groupings called out above, computed directly from the current
`replicate_group_summary.csv` (all-groups denominators) and
`flagged_review_queue.csv` / `review_queue_by_dimension_summary.csv`
(flagged-group numerators).

Overall statistical-flag baseline: **427 / 2712 ≈ 15.7%**.

For each row: `flag_rate` = flagged groups for that dimension value / all
replicate groups for that dimension value. `enrichment_vs_baseline` =
`flag_rate / (427/2712 * 100)`, reported as a multiple of the overall baseline
rate.

| Review dimension                                        | All replicate groups | % of all 2712 groups | Flagged groups | % of 427 flagged groups | Flag rate | Enrichment vs overall baseline |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------: | -------------------: | -------------: | ----------------------: | --------: | -----------------------------: |
| experiment_id = 47                                      |                  925 |                34.1% |            254 |                   59.5% |     27.5% |                          1.74x |
| experiment_id = 43                                      |                  336 |                12.4% |             61 |                   14.3% |     18.2% |                          1.15x |
| analysis_type = xrf                                     |                 1315 |                48.5% |            254 |                   59.5% |     19.3% |                          1.23x |
| provider = rigging                                      |                  178 |                 6.6% |             55 |                   12.9% |     30.9% |                          1.96x |
| sample_preparation_method = knife mill (2mm)            |                  952 |                35.1% |            197 |                   46.1% |     20.7% |                          1.31x |
| sample_preparation_method = oven dry + knife mill (2mm) |                  590 |                21.8% |            144 |                   33.7% |     24.4% |                          1.55x |

**How to read this table:** "% of flagged groups" answers _where the review
workload/backlog is concentrated_ (e.g., experiment 47 alone accounts for 59.5%
of the queue). "Flag rate" and "enrichment vs baseline" answer a different
question — _whether that grouping is flagged more often than its overall share
of the 2712-group dataset would suggest_ (e.g., `rigging` makes up only 6.6% of
all groups but 12.9% of flags, and its own flag rate of 30.9% is nearly double
the 15.7% dataset-wide baseline). These are purely descriptive comparisons —
enrichment above 1x is not interpreted causally (i.e., not "provider X causes
more flags"), only that the observed flag rate for that grouping sits above what
the overall baseline rate would predict.

**Correction — experiment_id = 47 framing:** an earlier version of this document
described experiment 47's 27.5% flag rate as "similar to" the 15.7% overall
baseline. That framing was incorrect: 27.5% is **1.74×** the overall baseline
rate, i.e. **elevated relative to baseline**, not similar. This does not change
the underlying counts or the statistical flag logic — only the interpretive
language describing that rate has been corrected.

### existing_QC_status overlap with statistical flags (descriptive only, no causal claim)

| existing_QC_status | n_flagged_groups | % of 427 | n_replicate_groups_total | flag_rate_percent |
| ------------------ | ---------------: | -------: | -----------------------: | ----------------: |
| pass               |              390 |    91.3% |                     1994 |             19.6% |
| (missing)          |               14 |     3.3% |                       83 |             16.9% |
| fail               |               12 |     2.8% |                      233 |              5.2% |
| fail,pass          |                7 |     1.6% |                        8 |             87.5% |
| pass,provisional   |                4 |     0.9% |                        4 |            100.0% |

**Important semantics correction:** `existing_QC_status` is built in Step 1 by
comma-joining the _distinct_ record-level QC statuses observed within a
replicate group. Comma-joined values like `fail,pass` and `pass,provisional`
therefore indicate that **that replicate group contains underlying records with
different/mixed QC statuses** — they are **not** standalone QC categories
equivalent to a clean `pass` or `fail`. Reading `fail,pass` as "the QC status is
fail-pass" would misrepresent what the value means; it means "this group's
underlying records disagreed."

The large majority of flagged groups (91.3%) already carry an
`existing_QC_status` of `pass` — expected, since `pass` is the dominant status
across the whole dataset (1994 of 2712 groups, 73.5%). Groups already marked
`fail` are actually flagged at a _lower_ rate (5.2%) than the dataset average
(15.7%). The two mixed-status categories (`fail,pass`, `pass,provisional`) show
much higher flag rates (87.5% and 100.0%, respectively), but their denominators
are extremely small (8 and 4 groups respectively) — **these high rates are not
emphasized as strong statistical evidence here**. Per the handoff's "statistical
flag ≠ bad data" / hedged-interpretation guardrails, these are better framed as
a small number of interesting candidates warranting direct human review (8 and 4
groups total) than as a robust finding about mixed-QC-status groups in general.
This is reported purely descriptively: it does **not** establish that
statistical flags validate or contradict prior analyst QC calls, only that their
overlap is uneven and worth noting for anyone designing a combined review
workflow.

## 3. Consolidation into investigation packets

### Chosen grouping key

`analysis_type + parameter + experiment_id`, evaluated with `dropna=False` so
that groups with a null `experiment_id` form their own explicit packet(s) rather
than being silently dropped.

**Documented limitation:** `experiment_id` is used here as a convenience
batching key. **The data does not establish that `experiment_id` corresponds to
a specific day/run/batch in a way that guarantees an analyst can investigate all
flagged groups within one experiment as a single coherent root-cause
investigation** — this is a provisional MVP simplification, not a validated
investigation unit.

### Grouping-key comparison (Part C.2)

| grouping_key                                                           | n_packets | median_group_size | max_group_size | n_singleton_packets | % singleton |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------: | ----------------: | -------------: | ------------------: | ----------: |
| base (analysis_type+parameter+experiment_id)                           |       114 |               2.0 |             30 |                  53 |       46.5% |
| +resource_id                                                           |       340 |               1.0 |              5 |                 273 |       80.3% |
| +provider                                                              |       297 |               1.0 |              6 |                 211 |       71.0% |
| +sample_preparation_method                                             |       144 |               2.0 |             18 |                  69 |       47.9% |
| +protocol_version                                                      |       114 |               2.0 |             30 |                  53 |       46.5% |
| +resource_id+provider+sample_preparation_method+protocol_version (all) |       379 |               1.0 |              4 |                 338 |       89.2% |

Adding `resource_id` or `provider` to the base key sharply increases packet
count toward the raw 427-group count (i.e., most added splits produce singleton
packets), defeating the purpose of consolidation. Adding `protocol_version`
changes nothing (it is 100% null dataset-wide, so it never actually splits any
group). `+sample_preparation_method` produces a modest increase (114 → 144
packets). The base key was retained for this MVP because it provides the most
consolidation while remaining a plausible — if unproven — review-batching unit.
**The chosen packet grouping key and its results are unchanged from before this
terminology correction** — only the `+lab`/`+method` labels in the comparison
table were renamed to `+provider`/`+sample_preparation_method`.

### Packet build and validation

`outputs/investigation_packets.csv` has **114 rows** (packets). Validation
performed by the script, all passing:

- `sum(n_flagged_groups_in_packet) == 427`: **PASS**
- No `replicate_group_id` appears in more than one packet: **PASS**
- Every one of the 427 flagged replicate groups appears in exactly one packet:
  **PASS**

### Packet statistics

- Total raw flagged groups: 427 (confirmed)
- Number of resulting packets: **114**
- Median flagged-groups-per-packet: **2.0**
- Max flagged-groups-in-one-packet: **30**
- Packets containing >1 flagged group: **61 (53.5% of 114 packets)**

Largest packets (for sanity-checking):

| packet_id   | analysis_type | parameter | experiment_id | n_flagged_groups_in_packet |
| ----------- | ------------- | --------- | ------------- | -------------------------: |
| xrf\|rb\|47 | xrf           | rb        | 47.0          |                         30 |
| xrf\|cu\|47 | xrf           | cu        | 47.0          |                         26 |
| xrf\|sr\|47 | xrf           | sr        | 47.0          |                         24 |

All three largest packets share `experiment_id=47.0`, consistent with §2's
finding that this single experiment accounts for the majority of raw flags.

## 4. Estimated analyst workload

**These are PLANNING SCENARIOS ONLY, not measured analyst-time estimates.** No
actual review-time data was collected; the numbers below are simple
minutes-per-review × unit-count arithmetic for planning purposes only.

| Scenario | Minutes/review | Total minutes (427 raw groups) | Total hours (427 raw groups) | Total minutes (114 packets) | Total hours (114 packets) |
| -------- | -------------: | -----------------------------: | ---------------------------: | --------------------------: | ------------------------: |
| Fast     |              5 |                           2135 |                         35.6 |                         570 |                       9.5 |
| Moderate |             10 |                           4270 |                         71.2 |                        1140 |                      19.0 |
| Thorough |             15 |                           6405 |                        106.8 |                        1710 |                      28.5 |

Approximate review rate, expressed per 100 replicate groups reviewed:

| Scenario                 | Min per 100 raw groups | Min per 100-raw-group-equivalent via packets |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------: | -------------------------------------------: |
| Fast (5 min/review)      |                    500 |                                         ~133 |
| Moderate (10 min/review) |                   1000 |                                         ~267 |
| Thorough (15 min/review) |                   1500 |                                         ~400 |

(Packet consolidation ratio: 114 / 427 = 0.267 — i.e., reviewing by packet
instead of by raw replicate group reduces the number of review units by ~73%,
assuming a packet takes roughly the same time to review as a single replicate
group, which is itself an unvalidated planning assumption.)

## 5. Implications for designing a practical BioCirV review workflow

The following observations are **descriptive and hedged, not prescriptive
production rules**:

- Packet-based review appears to reduce the effective queue size from 427
  individual replicate groups to 114 investigation units, suggesting
  investigation-level batching **may** be more efficient than reviewing every
  flagged replicate group independently — this is a planning observation, not a
  finalized workflow design.
- A disproportionate share of the raw backlog traces back to a small number of
  experiments (notably `experiment_id=47.0`, contributing 59.5% of all flags, at
  a flag rate 1.74× the overall baseline — elevated, not merely similar) and a
  handful of `xrf` trace-element parameters with high flag rates on modest
  denominators. A workflow **could** prioritize reviewing these
  high-concentration packets first, though this analysis does not establish that
  doing so is optimal or that these concentrations reflect anything beyond how
  the underlying screens (RSD, Dixon, 3×SD) behave on this particular data
  structure.
- Because `experiment_id` is not validated as a true batch/run identifier (see
  §3's documented limitation), any workflow built on
  `analysis_type + parameter + experiment_id` packets should treat that grouping
  as a starting hypothesis for investigation batching, not a guarantee that all
  groups within a packet share a common root cause.
- The overlap between statistical flags and existing `existing_QC_status` values
  (§2) is uneven but not straightforwardly interpretable — a workflow **could**
  consider cross-referencing statistical flags against existing QC status as one
  input among several, but this analysis does not establish that the two signals
  should be combined in any particular way. The two mixed-status categories in
  particular (`fail,pass`, `pass,provisional`) are backed by only 8 and 4 groups
  respectively and should be treated as candidates for direct human review, not
  as statistically robust findings.
- **None of the above implies that any flagged replicate group's underlying data
  is invalid, bad, or should be excluded.** This analysis organizes review
  workload; it does not make exclusion or validity determinations.

## 6. Validation summary

- `flagged_review_queue.csv`: **427 rows**, `flag_category` breakdown matches
  `candidate_rule_overlap_summary.csv` **exactly** across all 7
  mutually-exclusive categories (RSD_only=140, Dixon_only=224, 3xSD_only=23,
  RSD_and_Dixon=12, RSD_and_3xSD=18, Dixon_and_3xSD=3, all_three=7).
- `investigation_packets.csv`: **114 packets**,
  `sum(n_flagged_groups_in_packet) == 427` confirmed, no replicate group
  duplicated or omitted across packets.
- Every by-dimension grouping in Part B (`analysis_type`, `resource_type`,
  `experiment_id`, `provider`, `sample_preparation_method`, `protocol_version`,
  `existing_QC_status`) and the Part C packet grouping used
  `groupby(..., dropna=False)` so that null values (e.g., 10 groups with null
  `experiment_id` in the full dataset, 518 groups with null
  `sample_preparation_method`, 42 with null `provider`, all 2712 with null
  `protocol_version`) form their own explicit `(missing)` category rather than
  being silently dropped.
- Terminology correction confirmed: `flagged_review_queue.csv` and
  `review_queue_by_dimension_summary.csv` now expose `provider` and
  `sample_preparation_method` columns (aliased from the upstream `lab` and
  `method` columns respectively); the upstream Steps 1–8 CSVs
  (`replicate_group_summary.csv`, `method_parameter_summary.csv`,
  `candidate_rule_comparison.csv`, etc.) retain their original `lab`/ `method`
  column headers unchanged.
