# Step 4 & 5 Findings — Method × Parameter Summary and Review Heatmap

Scripts:
[`04_build_method_parameter_summary.py`](../04_build_method_parameter_summary.py),
[`05_build_review_heatmap.py`](../05_build_review_heatmap.py) Outputs:
[`outputs/method_parameter_summary.csv`](method_parameter_summary.csv) (74
rows), [`outputs/precision_review_heatmap.png`](precision_review_heatmap.png)

## 1. Overview

This document interprets `method_parameter_summary.csv` — 74 distinct
`analysis_type × parameter` combinations, each pooled from
`replicate_group_summary.csv`'s 2712 technical replicate groups (Step 1,
enriched in Step 3) — and its companion visual, `precision_review_heatmap.png`.
Both artifacts summarize replicate-level precision (SD, RSD) and candidate flag
rates (RSD benchmarks, Dixon Q) at the `analysis_type × parameter` grain;
neither recomputes anything from raw observations.

**Interpretation boundary** (restated from the heatmap script's docstring, and
binding on this document too): this is a **descriptive comparison tool** for
data coverage, typical/high-tail relative precision (RSD-based), and RSD/Dixon
flagging rates across combinations. It must **not** be used to choose final QC
thresholds, decide absolute-SD-vs-relative-RSD precision models, or rank
parameters by absolute SD (units differ across parameters, e.g., % for
compositional analytes vs. ppm for ICP/XRF). Those remain explicit human-review
decisions per the handoff's "Scientific Decisions After the MVP" section. Every
observation below is framed as a candidate for review, not a proposed cutoff —
"statistical flag ≠ bad data."

## 2. Column definitions

| Column                                                     | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## 3. Descriptive interpretation

### Coverage patterns

Coverage is highly uneven across the 74 combinations:

- **Best covered**: all four `proximate` parameters (`ash`, `moisture`,
  `total solids`, `volatile solids`) each have `n_replicate_groups=115` from 106
  independent samples — the single best-covered analytical family. A large block
  of `xrf` matrix/major elements (`ba`, `ca`, `fe`, `k`, `p`, `s`, `th`, `u`,
  `zn`, and others) each have `n_replicate_groups=55`.
- **Thinnest coverage**: `ultimate/carbon` and `ultimate/oxygen` each have only
  **1 replicate group from 1 sample** — no precision information can be drawn
  from a single group. `ultimate/sulfur` has 2 groups, `compositional/lignin+`
  has 4, and `compositional/arabinan` / `arabinose` have 7 each.
- **RSD structurally undefined**: 12 `xrf` trace parameters — `ag`, `bi`, `cd`,
  `cr`, `hg`, `nb`, `ni`, `sb`, `se`, `sn`, `v`, `w` — show
  `percent_RSD_defined = 0.0%`. Their `replicate_n_counts` is uniformly `"1:10"`
  (or `"1:12"` for `w`), meaning every replicate group for these parameters has
  exactly one replicate — RSD/SD can never be computed regardless of how much
  data is added later without a change in replicate design.
- **Dixon structurally unavailable for an entire analysis type**: all 15 `icp`
  parameters show `n_Dixon_calculated = 0` / `percent_Dixon_calculated = 0.0%`.
  ICP's `replicate_n_counts` tops out at `n_replicates = 2` (median_replicate_n
  = 1.0–2.0 across ICP parameters), and Dixon requires `3 ≤ n ≤ 30` — so Dixon
  is never applicable to ICP under the current replicate design, independent of
  sample count.
- **Ultimate analysis** broadly runs thin even where nominally "defined":
  `ultimate/dm` has `n_RSD_defined=1` of 13 groups (7.7%), `adf-r` and `cf` have
  4 of 13 (30.8%), `nitrogen` has 5 of 14 (35.7%) — these combinations' RSD
  quantiles are effectively built from a handful of points and should be read as
  point estimates, not real distributions.

### Typical precision patterns

`median_RSD` across the 74 combinations spans from 0% (several singleton/zero-SD
parameters — not a meaningful "perfect precision" signal, just structurally
undefined or trivial) up to 24.51% (`xrf/nd`, but backed by only 3 RSD-defined
groups — see caveats below). Restricting attention to combinations with a
reasonably large RSD-defined sample:

- **Proximate runs tightest**: `total solids` median_RSD = 0.31% (lowest of any
  well-populated combination), `moisture` = 0.99%, `volatile solids` = 1.05%,
  `ash` = 4.40% — consistent with these being core mass-balance measurements,
  all with 81.7–100% RSD coverage.
- **Compositional sugars are tight except the least-detected ones**: `glucan`
  (1.48%), `glucose` (1.53%), `lignin` (1.09%), `xylan` (2.12%), `xylose`
  (2.15%) all run low; `arabinan`/`arabinose` run notably higher (~6.5% median
  RSD) — these are also the two lowest-n, lowest-concentration sugars (spans of
  ~0.03–4 vs. tens for glucan/xylan), consistent with precision degrading near
  detection limits.
- **ICP looks fine at the median but has long high-RSD tails**: most ICP median
  RSDs sit in the 1.2–5.3% range, but `P90_RSD`/`P95_RSD` blow out for several
  elements (`ti`: P90=P95=141.4%; `nd`: P90=57.8%, P95=130.1%; `al`: P90=57.7%,
  P95=75.3%) — the median alone would hide these tails.
- **XRF is the most heterogeneous analysis type**: matrix elements (`ca`, `k`,
  `p`, `s`, `si`, `th`, `zn`) sit in a tight 2–6% median-RSD band, while several
  minor/trace elements (`ba` 16.4%, `mg` 16.2%, `mo` 15.7%, `pr` 15.2%, `ce`
  12.3%, plus the small-n `nd`/`y` cases) run much higher — consistent with
  expected XRF behavior near detection limits for trace analytes.

### High-variability tails

The largest `P90_RSD` values with a reasonably solid RSD-defined base (n≥14) are
`icp/ti` (P90=P95=141.42%, n_RSD_defined=14, 58.3% defined) and `icp/nd`
(P90=57.77%, P95=130.11%, n_RSD_defined=24, **100%** defined). Among `xrf`, `mo`
(P90=36.66%, n=21) and `ce` (P90=24.49%, n=23) stand out. By `percent_RSD_gt_20`
with adequate n: `xrf/mo` (42.86%, n=21), `xrf/ce` (39.13%, n=23), `icp/ti`
(42.86%, n=14), `icp/al` (29.17%, n=24, 100% defined), and `xrf/mg` (29.41%,
n=17) are the clearest candidates for concern.

### RSD/Dixon flagging patterns

Across combinations with adequate RSD coverage, `percent_RSD_gt_10` ranges from
0% up to extremes such as `xrf/mg` (88.24%, n_RSD_defined=17), `xrf/ba` (78.38%,
n=37), `xrf/mn` (66.67%, n=45), `xrf/ce` (65.22%, n=23), and `icp/al` (54.17%,
n=24, fully RSD-defined). Dixon flag rates show a largely **different** set of
high-flag combinations: `xrf/rb` (75.68%, n_Dixon_calculated=37), `xrf/sr`
(56.41%, n=39), `xrf/u` (54.76%, n=42), and `xrf/k` (33.33%, n=45) top the Dixon
list, none of which are the top RSD flaggers.

This mismatch previews the candidate-rule-comparison step (Step 8) and is
consistent with Step 3's replicate-group-level finding that RSD>20 and Dixon
flags overlap on only 19 of 2712 groups. At the combination level the
disagreement runs **both directions**:

- `xrf/mg`: RSD flags heavily (88.24% RSD>10, 29.41% RSD>20) while Dixon flags
  almost nothing (7.14% of 14 Dixon-calculated groups).
- `xrf/rb`/`xrf/sr`: the reverse — Dixon flags a majority of groups (75.68% /
  56.41%) while RSD>10 is comparatively rare (14.29% / 9.30%).

Neither pattern indicates one method is "wrong" — RSD is sensitive to overall
spread while Dixon is sensitive to one point standing out from an otherwise
tight cluster, and these are genuinely different failure modes.

### Data-quality caveats visible in the numbers

- The two smallest combinations, `ultimate/carbon` and `ultimate/oxygen`
  (`n_replicate_groups=1` each), cannot support any distributional statistic —
  their SD=0/RSD=0 reflects a single group, not measured precision.
- `xrf/nd` (median_RSD=24.51%, the highest of all 74 rows) and `xrf/y`
  (median_RSD=19.43%, percent_RSD_gt_10=100%) are backed by only 3 and 2
  RSD-defined groups respectively (9.4% and 16.7% `percent_RSD_defined`) — their
  headline numbers are the most extreme in the table but rest on the least data,
  so they should be treated as flagged-for-investigation rather than established
  high-variability parameters.
- `icp/ti`'s P90=P95=141.42% is driven by only 14 RSD-defined groups (58.3%
  of 24) — a single unusual group can dominate a percentile at this sample size.
- The 12 `xrf` trace parameters with `percent_RSD_defined=0%` and the entire
  `icp` analysis type with `percent_Dixon_calculated=0%` are not data-quality
  failures per se, but structural consequences of the replicate design
  (n_replicates capped at 1 or 2) — worth flagging to the human team as a
  possible design question (e.g., would triplicate ICP runs be valuable for
  Dixon-style single-outlier detection?) rather than an analysis bug.

## 4. Recommended combinations for Step 6 diagnostic review

Per the handoff's Step 6 guidance, the following **8** combinations were
selected using varied, documented reasons (not a single top-N-by-one-metric
list), and were checked for adequate `n_RSD_defined`/`n_Dixon_calculated` so the
resulting scatter plots will have enough points to be visually informative.

**Deliberately avoided despite topping a metric ranking:** `xrf/nd` (highest
median_RSD in the table, 24.51%) and `xrf/y` (percent_RSD_gt_10 = 100%) were
**not** selected even though they lead their respective metrics, because they
are backed by only 3 and 2 RSD-defined groups respectively — too few points to
produce a visually or statistically meaningful sample mean vs. SD/RSD scatter
plot in Step 6. `icp/ti`'s extreme P90/P95 RSD (141.42%) was considered for the
same reason as `icp/nd` but not selected in favor of `icp/nd`, since `icp/nd`
has full (100%) RSD coverage (24 of 24 groups) versus `icp/ti`'s partial
coverage (14 of 24, 58.3%), giving a more robust diagnostic plot for the same
"hidden tail" story.
