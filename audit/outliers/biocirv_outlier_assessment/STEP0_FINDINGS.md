## 2026-08-27 — Re-validation: `experiment_id` added to `REPLICATE_GROUP_KEYS`

**Design decision:** `experiment_id` was added to
`analysis_config.REPLICATE_GROUP_KEYS` (now
`['sample_id', 'analysis_type', 'parameter', 'unit', 'method', 'experiment_id']`,
previously `['sample_id', 'analysis_type', 'parameter', 'unit', 'method']`).
This is a natural analog to the handoff's optional `method / protocol_version`,
`lab` additions: it prevents accidentally pooling technical replicates that were
actually measured in genuinely different experimental runs. This makes
`replicate_group_summary.csv` (Step 1, built in a later task) keyed at
one-group-per-experimental-run granularity, while `sample_level_summary.csv`
(Step 2) will genuinely aggregate ACROSS `experiment_id` when a sample was
analyzed in more than one experiment — a real, non-trivial distinction between
the two outputs that did not previously exist.

**`experiment_id` column confirmed present** in `raw_extract_20260825.csv` (6155
rows). Null/missing `experiment_id`: **27 rows (0.44% of total rows)**. Per the
updated config comment, any downstream `groupby(REPLICATE_GROUP_KEYS, ...)` call
(notably in the future `01_build_replicate_summary.py`) must pass `dropna=False`
so these 27 rows form their own group rather than being silently dropped.
`00_validate_replicate_grouping.py` already used `dropna=False` in all of its
`groupby()` calls prior to this change, so no script fix was required for this
re-validation pass to be correct.

**Group-count comparison (OLD key, no `experiment_id` vs NEW key, with
`experiment_id`):**

| analysis_type | OLD n_groups | NEW n_groups | delta    |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------ | -------- |
| xrf           | 1315         | 1315         | +0       |
| proximate     | 424          | 460          | +36      |
| compositional | 345          | 352          | +7       |
| icp           | 410          | 518          | +108     |
| ultimate      | 57           | 57           | +0       |
| xrd           | 10           | 10           | +0       |
| **TOTAL**     | **2561**     | **2712**     | **+151** |

- Total groups **increased from 2561 to 2712 (+151, +5.9%)**, confirming the
  expected direction (splitting by `experiment_id` can only increase or maintain
  group count).
- This delta of **151** `sample_id × analysis_type × parameter × unit × method`
  combinations is the population that spanned **more than one `experiment_id`**
  in the raw extract — i.e., the set of cases Step 2's
  `sample_level_summary.csv` will need to genuinely aggregate over. Without
  `experiment_id` in the key, these 151 combinations were each being treated as
  one pooled replicate group; now each is split into 2+ per-experiment groups.
- `icp` shows by far the largest impact (+108 groups, ~26% increase over its old
  count of 410), followed by `proximate` (+36) and `compositional` (+7). `xrf`,
  `ultimate`, and `xrd` are unaffected (+0), meaning none of their pre-existing
  groups spanned more than one `experiment_id`.
- Singleton rate rose slightly, from **25.5% (653/2561)** under the old key to
  **27.5% (746/2712)** under the new key — expected, since splitting groups by
  `experiment_id` converts some previously-multi-row groups into singletons
  whenever a sample's replicates for a given run happened to fall into different
  experiments (or a once-larger group is split into a mix of singleton +
  multi-row groups).
- No other change in `method` behavior: the WITH/WITHOUT-`method` delta remains
  0 (method still does not discriminate any groups beyond what the other keys
  already do).

Full re-generated diagnostic output (per-`analysis_type` breakdown, sanity-check
samples, stop-condition assessment) using the new key follows below, written
fresh by `00_validate_replicate_grouping.py`.

## Step 0 Findings

Source raw extract: `raw_extract_20260825.csv`

Total rows: 6155

Confirmed current `analysis_config.REPLICATE_GROUP_KEYS`:
`['sample_id', 'analysis_type', 'parameter', 'unit', 'method', 'experiment_id']`

### Null `sample_id`

- Rows with null/missing `sample_id`: 0 (0.0% of total rows). These rows cannot
  be grouped by this key at all and were excluded from all grouping analysis
  below.

### Grouping with current key (WITH `method`)

- Total groups: 2712

- Singleton groups (n=1): 746 (27.5% of groups)

- Groups with n>=2 (usable for SD): 1966 (72.5% of groups)

### Grouping WITHOUT `method` (comparison)

- Total groups: 2712

- Singleton groups (n=1): 746 (27.5% of groups)

- Delta in group count (WITH - WITHOUT method): 0

- Rows with null/missing `method`: 890 (14.5% of groupable rows)

- Of 2712 WITHOUT-method groups, 0 (0.0%) contain >1 distinct `method` value,
  i.e. would be split further by adding `method` to the key.

### Per-`analysis_type` breakdown (current config key)

| analysis_type | n_rows | n_groups | n_singleton_groups | singleton_rate_pct | n_multi_groups |
| ------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | -------------- |
| xrf           | 2778   | 1315     | 536                | 40.8               | 779            |
| proximate     | 1338   | 460      | 21                 | 4.6                | 439            |
| compositional | 1044   | 352      | 2                  | 0.6                | 350            |
| icp           | 890    | 518      | 146                | 28.2               | 372            |
| ultimate      | 78     | 57       | 40                 | 70.2               | 17             |
| xrd           | 27     | 10       | 1                  | 10.0               | 9              |

### Sanity check: multi-row group `technical_replicate_no` samples

- Sample group 1
  `{'sample_id': '65', 'analysis_type': 'compositional', 'parameter': 'glucan', 'unit': '% dry weight', 'method': 'oven dry + knife mill (2mm)', 'experiment_id': '40'}`:
  n=2, technical_replicate_no=['1', '2'], values=[11.82, 11.89] — looks OK
  (distinct replicate numbers)

- Sample group 2
  `{'sample_id': '117', 'analysis_type': 'xrf', 'parameter': 'mo', 'unit': 'ppm', 'method': 'oven dry + knife mill (2mm)', 'experiment_id': '47'}`:
  n=3, technical_replicate_no=['2', '1', '3'], values=[4.0, 7.0, 5.0] — looks OK
  (distinct replicate numbers)

- Sample group 3
  `{'sample_id': '85', 'analysis_type': 'xrf', 'parameter': 'sr', 'unit': 'ppm', 'method': 'oven dry + knife mill (2mm)', 'experiment_id': '47'}`:
  n=3, technical_replicate_no=['2', '3', '1'], values=[39.0, 40.0, 41.0] — looks
  OK (distinct replicate numbers)

- Sample group 4
  `{'sample_id': '157', 'analysis_type': 'xrf', 'parameter': 'p', 'unit': 'ppm', 'method': 'knife mill (2mm)', 'experiment_id': '47'}`:
  n=3, technical_replicate_no=['1', '3', '2'], values=[1320.0, 1340.0, 1290.0] —
  looks OK (distinct replicate numbers)

- Sample group 5
  `{'sample_id': '22', 'analysis_type': 'icp', 'parameter': 'cu', 'unit': 'ppm', 'method': nan, 'experiment_id': '43'}`:
  n=2, technical_replicate_no=['2', '1'], values=[14.4, 22.1] — looks OK
  (distinct replicate numbers)

### Recommendation

`method` does not change the grouping at all for this snapshot (0 WITHOUT-method
groups would be split by adding `method`). It is safe to drop `method` from the
key without losing any discrimination, though keeping it does no harm either
since it produces the same groups. **Recommended: keep current
REPLICATE_GROUP_KEYS = ['sample_id', 'analysis_type', 'parameter', 'unit',
'method', 'experiment_id']** (no change needed; method is harmless to retain,
and retaining it keeps the key aligned with the handoff's suggested key of
`sample_id + analysis_type + parameter + method/protocol_version + lab`).

### Stop-condition assessment (handoff Step 0)

Overall singleton rate with current key: 27.5% (746 / 2712 groups).

Sample sanity check: 0 / 5 sampled multi-row groups showed duplicate/suspicious
`technical_replicate_no` values.

**STOP CONDITION: NOT TRIGGERED.** The singleton rate and replicate-number
sanity check do not indicate a broken grouping key overall — it looks reasonable
to proceed to Step 1 (Build the Replicate-Group Summary) using the recommended
key above. Note that some individual `analysis_type` values with low row counts
(e.g. `ultimate`, `xrd`) may still have high singleton rates purely due to low
data volume — see the per-analysis_type breakdown above; these should be carried
forward with n=1 documented per the handoff's "carry both forward" spirit, not
treated as a general grouping failure.
