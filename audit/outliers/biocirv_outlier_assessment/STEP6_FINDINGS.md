# Step 6 Findings — Selected Diagnostic Plots

Script: [`07_selected_diagnostics.py`](07_selected_diagnostics.py) Inputs:
[`outputs/replicate_group_summary.csv`](outputs/replicate_group_summary.csv)
(2712 rows),
[`outputs/precision_model_diagnostics.csv`](outputs/precision_model_diagnostics.csv)
(74 rows, built by
[`06a_build_precision_model_diagnostics.py`](06a_build_precision_model_diagnostics.py))
Outputs: [`outputs/plots_selected/`](outputs/plots_selected/) (4 PNGs, one
combined figure per selected combination)

## 1. Overview

This step selects a small number of representative `analysis_type × parameter`
combinations **after** reviewing the comprehensive 74-row precision-model screen
(Step 6a), rather than reusing the original handoff's pre-fixed 8-combination
list. One combination is selected per non-trivial `precision_model_category`
(`approx_constant_absolute_SD`, `approx_constant_relative_RSD`,
`concentration_dependent_mixed`, `unclear`), and each is rendered as ONE
combined figure containing two side-by-side subplots — sample mean vs. replicate
SD on the left, sample mean vs. replicate RSD on the right — for a total of 4
PNGs. The proposed `precision_model_category` is displayed as a prominent
suptitle at the top of each figure and is also embedded directly in the output
filename (e.g. `proximate_volatile_solids_approx_constant_absolute_SD.png`), so
the category is visible both when viewing an image and when browsing the output
directory.

**Interpretation boundary** (consistent with the rest of this pipeline): these
plots visually validate/explain classifications that already exist in
`precision_model_diagnostics.csv`. They introduce no new statistical claims and
are not a basis for choosing production QC thresholds.

## 2. Two corrections applied to the underlying pipeline

Two fixes were applied to upstream scripts before this step's current selections
and plots were generated (see git history for `01_build_replicate_summary.py`
and `06a_build_precision_model_diagnostics.py` for the full commit-level
detail):

1. **`RSD_percent` sign fix (Step 1).**
   [`01_build_replicate_summary.py`](01_build_replicate_summary.py:151) computes
   `RSD_percent = (sd / abs(mean)) * 100.0`, using the absolute value of the
   mean in the denominator. Previously the signed mean was used, which produced
   **negative** RSD% values for the 13 `icp/na` replicate groups with a negative
   `mean` (a legitimate outcome of background/blank subtraction upstream) —
   contrary to the standard convention that RSD is a non-negative dispersion
   measure. This corrupted every downstream RSD-based comparison for `icp/na`
   specifically (RSD benchmark flags, `spearman_mean_vs_RSD` correlation, and
   any RSD quantile/percentile touching those 13 rows). Only `icp/na` rows were
   affected (13 of 2712 replicate groups, 0.48%); all other combinations' RSD
   values were computed from positive means and are numerically unaffected.

2. **`classify_precision_model()` redesign (Step 6a).**
   [`06a_build_precision_model_diagnostics.py`](06a_build_precision_model_diagnostics.py:201)
   no longer gates the stability categories (`approx_constant_absolute_SD`,
   `approx_constant_relative_RSD`) behind a blanket `loglog_r_squared >= 0.3`
   check. That gate was self-defeating: a genuinely flat/no-trend SD-vs-mean
   pattern naturally produces _both_ a near-zero slope _and_ a low R² (there's
   little real variance for a log-log fit to explain when there's no real
   trend), so the old gate made `approx_constant_absolute_SD` nearly unreachable
   for real flat data — 0 of 74 combinations qualified under the old logic. The
   current function instead corroborates each stability pattern independently
   via the corresponding Spearman correlation magnitude (`spearman_mean_vs_SD`
   for absolute-SD, `spearman_mean_vs_RSD` for relative-RSD) being small
   (`<= 0.3`). The R² threshold is retained but repurposed and lowered (`0.3` →
   `0.15`) to distinguish `concentration_dependent_mixed` from `unclear` only.

**Current category distribution** (`precision_model_diagnostics.csv`,
regenerated with both fixes applied):

| Category                        | Count |
| ------------------------------- | ----: |
| `insufficient_data`             |    26 |
| `unclear`                       |    10 |
| `concentration_dependent_mixed` |    20 |
| `approx_constant_relative_RSD`  |    13 |
| `approx_constant_absolute_SD`   |     5 |

`approx_constant_absolute_SD` now has 5 real members — `compositional/xylan`,
`compositional/xylose`, `icp/si`, `xrf/k`, and `proximate/volatile solids` —
where previously zero combinations qualified, which is why §4 below no longer
needs a non-qualifying placeholder pick for that category.

## 3. Selected combinations and reasoning

All 74 rows of `precision_model_diagnostics.csv` were reviewed directly.
Category counts going in: `insufficient_data`=26, `unclear`=10,
`concentration_dependent_mixed`=20, `approx_constant_relative_RSD`=13,
`approx_constant_absolute_SD`=5.

### `proximate / volatile solids` — `approx_constant_absolute_SD` (best of 5)

Largest `n_points_usable_for_loglog` (115) of any row in the entire 74-row
table, with `loglog_slope=-0.091` and `loglog_r_squared=0.006` (the log-log fit
itself is negligible, consistent with "no real trend to fit") and
`spearman_mean_vs_SD=-0.289` (small magnitude, corroborating "no
concentration-dependence" independent of the noisy log-log fit). A
well-populated, genuine positive example for this category.

### `icp / ca` — `approx_constant_relative_RSD` (best of 13)

Highest `loglog_r_squared` (0.886, slope=1.056) among the 13 rows classified as
`approx_constant_relative_RSD` (next-best: `k` R²=0.876, `p` R²=0.856, `mg`
R²=0.791), with n=30 usable log-log points — a well-populated sample, not a thin
5–6 point option.

### `xrf / zn` — `concentration_dependent_mixed` (representative)

Slope=0.529 sits cleanly inside the 0.4–0.6 "real relationship, not close to 0
or 1" band, with R²=0.438 and n=41 usable log-log points — the largest n of any
candidate in that slope band (alternatives considered: `al`
slope=0.587/R²=0.321/n=21; `fe` slope=0.606/R²=0.359/n=45).

### `proximate / total solids` — `unclear` (representative, largest n)

Largest `n_points_usable_for_loglog` (115) of any row remaining in the `unclear`
category, with `loglog_r_squared=0.085` (weak log-log fit) and
`loglog_slope=-0.696` (not close to 0 or 1) — a genuinely ambiguous case, not a
low-n artifact.

## 4. Plot design

Each of the 4 PNGs (`{analysis_type}_{parameter}_{precision_model_category}.png`
in `outputs/plots_selected/` — category is embedded in the filename):

- Contains two side-by-side subplots sharing one figure: mean vs.
  `standard_deviation` on the left, mean vs. `RSD_percent` on the right (one
  point per replicate group, `mean` on the x-axis in both).
- Displays a three-line figure-level title: the combination name (small), then
  **"PROPOSED precision_model_category: {category}"** as the most visually
  prominent line (large, bold — the "PROPOSED" prefix makes clear this is an
  exploratory triage label, not a finalized/validated categorization), then the
  underlying `loglog_slope` / `loglog_r_squared` diagnostics (small, italic)
  with the "not a validated statistical cutoff" caveat.
- **Labels high-leverage points with their `replicate_group_id`** directly on
  the plot, so a reviewer can go from "that point looks high" straight to the
  exact replicate group / sample / resource / experiment to pull up in
  `replicate_group_summary.csv`, without needing to cross-reference by eye. A
  point qualifies as high-leverage (evaluated independently per combination,
  using that combination's own `standard_deviation` values) when EITHER:
  - `RSD_percent > 20`, or
  - `standard_deviation > 2 × median(standard_deviation)` computed within that
    same `analysis_type × parameter` combination (a per-combination median, not
    a global one, since absolute SD units differ by parameter).
- Each subplot independently color-codes points by `resource_type` with a legend
  when ≤15 distinct values are present in that subplot's plotted subset; falls
  back to a single color and documents that fallback in the subplot's own
  caption otherwise (all 4 selected combinations in practice exceeded 15
  distinct `resource_type` values on both subplots and used the fallback — see
  run results below).
- Explicitly counts and captions NaN-excluded points (singleton replicate groups
  with undefined SD/RSD) and the high-leverage-labeled point count, per subplot,
  rather than silently dropping/omitting them.

## 5. Run results

| Combination                   | Category (role)                           | Plotted / NaN-excluded | High-leverage labeled | Distinct `resource_type` | Color-coded?  |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------: | --------------------: | -----------------------: | ------------- |
| `proximate / volatile solids` | approx_constant_absolute_SD (best of 5)   |                115 / 0 |                    38 |                       40 | No (fallback) |
| `icp / ca`                    | approx_constant_relative_RSD (best of 13) |                30 / 20 |                     7 |                       16 | No (fallback) |
| `xrf / zn`                    | concentration_dependent_mixed             |                45 / 10 |                    10 |                       22 | No (fallback) |
| `proximate / total solids`    | unclear (largest n in category)           |                115 / 0 |                    44 |                       40 | No (fallback) |

(Counts differ between a combination's SD and RSD subplot only when
`standard_deviation` and `RSD_percent` have different NaN masks, e.g. a
non-near-zero-mean singleton group has both undefined, but a near-zero-mean
multi-replicate group can have a defined SD and an undefined RSD — for the 4
selected combinations here the two subplots' counts happen to match.
High-leverage counts are also identical between a combination's two subplots,
since the high-leverage flag is computed once per replicate group from that
combination's full data, not independently per metric.)

## 6. Observations from reviewing the rendered plots

Visual review of the 4 combined figures (8 subplots total) surfaced two useful
patterns worth recording even though they are outside this step's scope to act
on:

- **High-leverage points are now labeled, but dense low-mean/high-RSD clusters
  can still crowd labels together.** For `proximate/volatile solids` and
  `proximate/total solids` specifically, a large fraction of points qualify as
  high-leverage (38 and 44 of 115 respectively, driven mostly by the
  `RSD_percent > 20` criterion at low sample means where RSD is naturally
  noisier), which produces some visual crowding among overlapping
  `replicate_group_id` labels in that region. `icp/ca` and `xrf/zn` (7 and 10
  high-leverage points respectively) render cleanly with no crowding. This is a
  consequence of the underlying data's RSD distribution at low concentrations,
  not a defect in the labeling logic itself — a future refinement could consider
  a stricter/tunable high-leverage threshold or `adjustText`-style label
  repulsion if this becomes a practical review obstacle.
- **The remaining `unclear` / `concentration_dependent_mixed` categories are
  still genuine grab-bags,** now smaller (10 and 20 combinations respectively)
  than before the classifier redesign but still defined largely by what they are
  _not_ (not a stability pattern, and either weak or unclassifiable log-log
  fit). Visual inspection suggests some `unclear`/mixed combinations likely have
  a legitimate absolute-SD or relative-RSD structure that the simple log-log
  heuristic's R²/slope thresholds are still missing (e.g., driven by a handful
  of high-leverage points, non-linear relationships, or matrix/resource-type
  subgroups with different behavior pooled together). The current 74-row
  categorization should not be treated as a finished answer for these two
  categories.

## 7. Future work (not implemented in this step — recorded here per scope boundary)

This item is also flagged as a future to-do in the handoff document
(`biocirv_outlier_assessment_handoff_v4.md`, "Future Enhancements Identified
During Step 6 Review" section). It is explicitly **out of scope** for this
step's script and was not implemented in `07_selected_diagnostics.py`. (The
high-leverage-point-labeling item previously listed here has since been
implemented — see §4 above.)

1. **Human review (or a programmatic threshold refinement) of the `unclear` and
   `concentration_dependent_mixed` categories to differentiate into SD-dominant,
   RSD-dominant, or genuinely-mixed behavior.** Either:
   - a human reviewer works through the SD and RSD scatter plots for all
     combinations currently labeled `unclear` (10) or
     `concentration_dependent_mixed` (20) and records a differentiated judgment
     per combination, or
   - the categorization heuristic in
     [`06a_build_precision_model_diagnostics.py`](06a_build_precision_model_diagnostics.py)
     (`classify_precision_model()`, `SLOPE_TOLERANCE=0.3`,
     `SPEARMAN_TOLERANCE=0.3`, `CONCENTRATION_CLEAR_R_SQUARED_MIN=0.15`) is
     revisited to see whether adjusted or additional decision bounds (e.g.,
     separate SD-only and RSD-only log-log fits, rather than a single combined
     slope/R² pair) can programmatically split today's `unclear`/mixed bucket
     into SD-dominant, RSD-dominant, and genuinely-mixed sub-categories.

   Per the handoff's "Scientific Decisions After the MVP" guardrails, any
   changed thresholds remain a human decision, not something a coding agent
   should choose unilaterally.
