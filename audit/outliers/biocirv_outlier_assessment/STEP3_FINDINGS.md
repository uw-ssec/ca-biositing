# Step 3 Findings — Candidate Replicate-Level Flags

Script: [`03_add_candidate_flags.py`](03_add_candidate_flags.py) Output:
[`outputs/replicate_group_summary.csv`](outputs/replicate_group_summary.csv)
(enriched **in place** — same file as Step 1, still 2712 rows)

## What this step adds

Three exploratory, non-production candidate flag/status sets, added as new
columns on the existing Step 1 replicate-group table:

1. `rsd_gt_{threshold}` gives percent of data greater than ("gt") the given
   threshold for each threshold in `analysis_config.RSD_BENCHMARK_THRESHOLDS`
   (currently `[10, 20]`) — comparison benchmarks only, not proposed BioCirV
   thresholds.
2. `dixon_q_statistic`, `dixon_candidate_record_id`, `dixon_flag_0_05`,
   `dixon_status` — classical Dixon's Q test (r10 statistic), single-pass,
   flag-only (never removes/reruns).
3. `rout_status`, `rout_status_reason` — placeholder only; ROUT was not
   implemented from scratch per handoff guardrail.

## RSD sensitivity flags

- RSD undefined (`RSD_percent` is NaN): **757 groups (27.9%)**
- `rsd_gt_10 == True`: **400 groups** (14.7% of all 2712 groups; 20.5% of the
  1955 RSD-defined groups)
- `rsd_gt_20 == True`: **171 groups** (6.3% of all groups; 8.7% of RSD-defined
  groups)

**Correction (added after the Step 6 `RSD_percent` sign-fix — see
STEP6_FINDINGS.md §2):** The two counts above (400 / 171) were computed _before_
[`01_build_replicate_summary.py`](01_build_replicate_summary.py:151) was
corrected to compute `RSD_percent = (sd / abs(mean)) * 100.0` (absolute value of
the mean in the denominator). Before that fix, the 13 `icp/na` replicate groups
with a negative `mean` produced a **negative** `RSD_percent`, which could never
satisfy the `RSD_percent > 10` / `> 20` boolean comparisons regardless of the
underlying RSD magnitude — undercounting both flags by a small,
`icp/na`-specific amount. After the fix, `replicate_group_summary.csv` reports
**407 groups** with `rsd_gt_10 == True` (15.0% of all 2712; 20.8% of the 1955
RSD-defined groups) and **177 groups** with `rsd_gt_20 == True` (6.5% of all
groups; 9.1% of RSD-defined groups) — see STEP8_FINDINGS.md §1 and
STEP9_FINDINGS.md §1 for these corrected, final figures, which are the ones used
throughout the rest of the pipeline (Step 8 onward). The 400 / 171 figures above
are left unedited as the historical record of what this step originally
computed; **do not cite 400 / 171 elsewhere — use 407 / 177.**

## Dixon Q test

Critical-value table source: Rorabacher, D. B. (1991), _Analytical Chemistry_
63(2), 139-146 — standard extended two-tailed alpha=0.05 Dixon's Q critical
values, n = 3 to 30.

`dixon_status` breakdown (2712 total groups):

| dixon_status                                       | count | %     |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----- |
| `calculated`                                       | 1447  | 53.4% |
| `not_applicable_n_out_of_range` (n<3 or n>30)      | 1238  | 45.6% |
| `not_applicable_zero_range` (all values identical) | 27    | 1.0%  |
| `skipped_data_mismatch`                            | 0     | 0.0%  |

- `dixon_flag_0_05 == True`: **246 of 1447 calculated groups (17.0%)**
- No `values`/`source_record_ids` length mismatches were encountered in the full
  dataset (0 groups skipped for this reason).

### Spot-check (manually verified)

`replicate_group_id=8`, sample 148, compositional/xylan, n=3,
`values = [15.17, 17.03, 17.04]`:

- sorted: `[15.17, 17.03, 17.04]`
- `range_val = 17.04 - 15.17 = 1.87`
- `Q_low = (17.03-15.17)/1.87 = 0.99465`;
  `Q_high = (17.04-17.03)/1.87 = 0.00535`
- `dixon_q_statistic = max = 0.99465`; candidate record = `(04)68e4` (the low
  extreme, since `Q_low >= Q_high`)
- critical value for n=3 (alpha=0.05) = `0.970`
- `0.99465 > 0.970` → `dixon_flag_0_05 = True` ✓

For an n=2 group (`replicate_group_id=56`), `dixon_status` correctly reads
`not_applicable_n_out_of_range`, with `dixon_q_statistic`/
`dixon_candidate_record_id`/`dixon_flag_0_05` all null.

## RSD (>20%) × Dixon (0.05) overlap — 2×2 cross-tab

Preview of the "candidate rule comparison" work planned for a later step; useful
now as a sanity check that the two methods are not simply redundant.

|                        | Dixon flagged | Dixon not flagged | Row total |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| **RSD>20 flagged**     | 19            | 152               | 171       |
| **RSD>20 not flagged** | 227           | 2314              | 2541      |
| **Column total**       | 246           | 2466              | 2712      |

Only 19 groups are flagged by both methods; each method independently flags a
substantial, largely non-overlapping set of additional groups (152 RSD-only, 227
Dixon-only). This indicates the two candidate rules are sensitive to different
failure patterns (RSD>20 flags overall spread regardless of shape; Dixon flags a
single extreme value relative to the group's range) and should be compared side
by side in later review rather than treated as interchangeable.

**Correction (post Step-6 RSD sign-fix):** the table above reflects the pre-fix
`RSD_percent` (see the correction note in "RSD sensitivity flags" above). After
the fix, the corrected cross-tab (`replicate_group_summary.csv`, current) is:

|                        | Dixon flagged | Dixon not flagged | Row total |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| **RSD>20 flagged**     | 19            | 158               | 177       |
| **RSD>20 not flagged** | 227           | 2308              | 2535      |
| **Column total**       | 246           | 2466              | 2712      |

The both-flagged count (19) is unchanged by the fix (Dixon does not depend on
`RSD_percent`'s sign); only the RSD>20-only cell moves from 152→158 and the
RSD>20 row total from 171→177, consistent with the correction above. Use this
corrected table, not the original one, for any downstream citation.

## ROUT placeholder

`rout_status == "not_calculated"` confirmed for all **2712/2712** rows.
`rout_status_reason` is populated from `analysis_config.ROUT_STATUS_REASON` on
every row.

## Guardrails honored

- Dixon is a flag only — no `values`/rows were modified or excluded based on the
  Dixon result.
- Single-pass Dixon calculation; no sequential remove-and-rerun.
- ROUT not implemented from scratch; explicit status/reason recorded instead of
  a silent omission.
- Every "not calculated" case (`n_out_of_range`, `zero_range`, `data_mismatch`)
  has an explicit `dixon_status` value rather than a bare NaN with no
  explanation.
