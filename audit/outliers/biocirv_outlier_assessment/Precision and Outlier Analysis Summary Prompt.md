Final synthesis — BioCirV Exploratory Precision & Outlier Analysis Goal

Create one comprehensive, colleague-facing Markdown report summarizing the
completed BioCirV Exploratory Outlier & Variance Analysis.

The analysis itself is complete through Steps 0–10. This task is verification +
synthesis only, not another analysis step.

The final report should explain:

what data and questions were included; what we learned about replicate
precision; why relative and absolute variability need to be distinguished; what
the candidate outlier/high-variance screens detect; how large the resulting
review backlog is and where it is concentrated; how that backlog can be
organized into practical human investigations; implications for analysts;
implications for frontend data visualization; what remains unresolved and should
be discussed by the team.

Do NOT describe this work as an “MVP.” Use:

Exploratory Outlier & Variance Analysis

throughout.

Critical guardrail: Steps 0–10 are frozen

Do NOT:

modify any Step 0–10 scripts; modify any existing Step findings documents;
modify any Step 0–10 CSV outputs; rerun the statistical pipeline; change RSD,
Dixon, or 3×SD methodology; implement ROUT; introduce new statistical
thresholds; create new exploratory analyses; create new figures or CSVs; state
or imply that a statistical flag establishes that an observation is wrong or
should be deleted.

You MAY perform simple arithmetic/checks needed to verify values already
reported, such as percentages, denominator checks, enrichment ratios, or
review-time conversions.

Create one new file only:

audit/outliers/biocirv_outlier_assessment/BIOCIRV_REPLICATE_PRECISION_OUTLIER_ASSESSMENT.md

1. Verify source material before writing

Before drafting the report, inspect the current analysis directory and verify
the values you will use.

Read the relevant findings documents:

README.md STEP0_FINDINGS.md STEP2_FINDINGS.md STEP3_FINDINGS.md
STEP4_5_FINDINGS.md STEP6_FINDINGS.md STEP8_FINDINGS.md STEP9_FINDINGS.md
STEP10_FINDINGS.md favorite_findings_sections.md if present

Also inspect the current output CSVs as needed, especially:

outputs/replicate_group_summary.csv analysis×parameter summary output
precision-model diagnostics output Step 8 candidate-rule comparison/overlap
outputs outputs/flagged_review_queue.csv
outputs/review_queue_by_analysis_parameter.csv
outputs/review_queue_by_dimension_summary.csv outputs/investigation_packets.csv
outputs/human_review_priorities.csv Verification expectations

Confirm against the current files rather than blindly copying numbers from this
prompt.

Expected major invariants include:

2712 replicate groups total RSD >10: 407 RSD >20: 177 Dixon: 246 exploratory
3×SD: 51 flagged by at least one of RSD>20 / Dixon / 3×SD: 427 Step 9 queue: 427
investigation packets: 114 packet membership total: 427 final relative/absolute
precision categories: 26 insufficient data 10 unclear 20 concentration-dependent
mixed 13 approximately constant relative RSD 5 approximately constant absolute
SD

Verify the final Step 10 priority table and its cumulative unique coverage
directly from STEP10_FINDINGS.md / human_review_priorities.csv.

Source precedence / inconsistencies

Some earlier findings documents may contain terminology or numerical framing
that was corrected later.

Prefer the latest corrected outputs/findings for that topic, particularly:

corrected precision diagnostics for relative/absolute behavior; final Step 8
candidate-screen counts; corrected Step 9 terminology and baseline/enrichment
framing; final Step 10 review priorities.

If two current sources genuinely conflict and there is no obvious
corrected/latest source resolving them, do not silently invent a resolution.
Note the inconsistency in your completion summary and use cautious wording in
the report.

Correct human-facing terminology throughout:

provider = source/provider (Source_codename), not laboratory sample preparation
method = legacy normalized method field, not analytical method

Do not call rigging a lab.

Do not call knife mill (2mm) or oven dry + knife mill (2mm) analytical methods.

Writing approach

Write this as an analytical report for colleagues, not as a coding/pipeline log.

Explain only the methodology necessary to understand:

what a result means; its denominator/applicability; what conclusion is
supported; what conclusion is NOT supported.

Be generous with informative existing tables and figures.

Use concise prose around them so readers understand why each matters.

Add prominent callouts throughout:

Flagged for further discussion: ...

Flagged for further analysis: ...

Place these directly beside the relevant finding instead of collecting all
unresolved issues at the end.

Step terminology

There is one exception where Step numbers should be prominent: the Methods
overview table showing how Steps 0–10 built on one another.

Outside that table:

avoid Step numbers in section/subsection headings; prefer descriptive headings
such as “Observed Relative vs. Absolute Error Behavior” rather than “Step 6
Results”; avoid repeatedly saying “Step 8 found…” or “Step 9 showed…” unless a
Step reference is useful for traceability. Report structure

1. Executive Summary

Keep this concise and decision-oriented.

Summarize:

scope of the exploratory analysis; broad picture of replicate precision; major
analysis families / parameters needing attention; final review backlog of 427 /
2712 replicate groups; the fact that the statistical screens detect different
forms of unusual replicate behavior; concentration of the review burden; ability
to organize most of the backlog into a small number of coherent human
investigations.

Avoid reducing analyses to “good” or “bad.”

Explicitly distinguish:

typical precision; upper-tail variability; flag rate; raw contribution to the
queue; evidence sufficiency.

State clearly:

Statistical flag ≠ bad data. A statistical flag identifies a replicate group
worth reviewing; it does not independently establish measurement error or
justify exclusion.

2. Methods and Scope Scope of the Exploratory Outlier & Variance Analysis

Briefly describe what was and was not evaluated.

Include:

focus on characterization measurements; no bioconversion/process-performance
data; several characterization analyses were skipped if the available
data/schema did not support this replicate-analysis workflow; identify the
analyses actually included using the source files; the exploratory analysis used
the available extracted dataset rather than querying the live BioCirV database;
future work would make this a repeatable workflow operating against the staging
database.

Do not imply that staging/live integration already exists.

How the analysis activities built on each other

Include:

Step Activity Goal / question answered

Give a concise overview of Steps 0–10.

The table should make clear the progression:

replicate-group validation → replicate precision → candidate flags →
analysis×parameter summaries → relative-vs-absolute error behavior →
candidate-screen comparison → review backlog characterization → investigation
consolidation → human-review prioritization.

This table is the primary place in the report where Step numbers should be used.

3. Precision Findings What variability at different grains tells us

Explain the theory behind examining variability at several levels:

Replicate group

within-sample technical repeatability; asks how consistently the same sample is
measured under the same analysis/parameter conditions.

Independent sample

distinguishes within-sample analytical variability from differences among
separate physical samples; between-sample variation can reflect genuine material
heterogeneity and should not automatically be interpreted as analytical error.

Analysis × parameter

pools many replicate groups for a particular measurement; characterizes what
precision typically looks like for that measurement across the dataset.

Analysis type

provides a higher-level view of whether precision concerns are broadly
distributed across an analytical family or concentrated in particular
parameters.

Explain why this is useful to BioCirV.

An absolute statement such as “SD = 3” is not inherently meaningful across all
measurements. Whether SD=3 is small or large depends on:

units; concentration/value range; expected within-replicate precision; whether
error behaves more like constant absolute error or constant relative error.

Also explain the limits:

between-sample/resource variability is not automatically measurement error; a
precision distribution does not tell us which individual observation is wrong;
statistical summaries do not independently justify deletion; sparse replicate
evidence cannot support strong precision conclusions. Metrics used to
characterize precision

Preserve a useful version of the column-definition table in
favorite_findings_sections.md.

Use a reader-friendly format such as:

Metric Definition / denominator How to interpret it

Include at minimum:

n_replicate_groups n_independent_samples replicate_n_counts median replicate n
min/max/sample-mean span median / Q1 / Q3 SD median / Q1 / Q3 / P90 / P95 RSD
n_RSD_defined / % RSD defined % RSD >10 % RSD >20 Dixon applicability Dixon
flagged %

Preserve these important qualifications:

absolute SD retains each parameter's units and should not be directly compared
across unrelated parameters; RSD is relative (%) and therefore better suited to
comparing measurements operating at different concentration scales; singleton
groups have undefined SD/RSD where appropriate and were not coerced to zero;
RSD>10 and RSD>20 are exploratory comparison benchmarks here, not adopted
BioCirV production thresholds; ROUT was not implemented and should not be given
a fabricated result. Precision by analysis × parameter

Include a useful analysis×parameter table containing:

| Analysis | Parameter | n replicate groups | % RSD defined | Median RSD | P90
RSD | Median SD |

Keep enough rows to make the result substantive.

If the full table is manageable, include it.

If it is too long:

place a representative / notable subset in the main narrative; place the
complete table in the appendix.

Accompany the table with interpretation of:

typical precision; upper-tail variability; data sufficiency; parameters with
particularly notable patterns. Precision by analysis type

Include:

| Analysis | Overall precision | Typical precision across parameters | Main
issue | Parameters needing attention | Frontend implication |

Use nuanced wording supported by the actual metrics.

Important interpretive guardrails:

Proximate

Typical replicate precision may be generally good while some high-volume
parameters still contribute many flagged groups.

Do not equate presence in the Step 10 review queue with poor overall precision.

For example, verify the final values for:

volatile solids; total solids; ash.

Volatile solids and total solids contribute meaningful numbers of flagged groups
despite their overall flag rates being below the dataset-wide 15.7% baseline,
while ash is somewhat more elevated.

Explain the distinction between:

typical precision and review-queue contribution.

XRF

Do not simply say “XRF is poor.”

XRF contributes a large share of the queue partly because it is the largest
analysis family.

Verify and explain the difference between:

XRF's share of the dataset; its overall flag rate; the much higher flag rates of
particular XRF parameters such as Rb, Cu, Sr, U and others. Other analyses

Describe ICP, compositional, ultimate, XRD, etc. according to the actual
evidence.

Sparse analyses should be described as insufficient evidence, not as high
precision because they happened to produce few flags.

Add Flagged for further discussion callouts where parameter-level precision may
warrant:

additional replicate collection; analyst attention; frontend context. 4.
Relative vs. Absolute Error Behavior Why distinguish relative and absolute
variability?

Explain:

RSD / relative variability

How large is replicate disagreement relative to the magnitude of the
measurement?

SD / absolute variability

How large is replicate disagreement on the measurement's absolute scale?

Explain why this distinction matters:

values near zero can produce very high RSD despite modest absolute differences;
some measurements may have roughly constant absolute error; some errors may
scale with concentration; some measurements show mixed behavior; therefore one
universal RSD or absolute-SD error model may not work for every
analysis×parameter.

Include this table:

What you see Best interpretation SD flat; RSD decreases with mean
Absolute-SD-like SD rises with mean; RSD flat Relative/RSD-like Both strongly
depend on mean Neither simple model fits Neither clearly depends on mean Could
be either; possibly too little range/data High RSD mostly near zero Possible
low-concentration artifact; inspect absolute SD Observed precision-model
behavior

Verify and include the final category counts:

Category Count Insufficient data 26 Unclear 10 Concentration-dependent mixed 20
Approximately constant relative RSD 13 Approximately constant absolute SD 5

Explain the implication:

Only a minority of analysis×parameter combinations clearly support a
constant-absolute-SD model; many behave more like relative error, mixed
concentration dependence, unclear behavior, or lack sufficient evidence.

Use existing diagnostic figures generously if they help readers visually
understand:

absolute-like; relative-like; mixed; unclear.

Do NOT generate new figures.

Flagged for further analysis: Manually review mixed and unclear diagnostic plots
before assigning an analysis×parameter to a relative- or absolute-error model.

Flagged for further analysis: During visual diagnostic review, consider labeling
unusually extreme RSD>20 / 3×SD points with their replicate-group IDs so
conspicuous cases can be traced directly back to source records.

5. Candidate Outlier & High-Variance Screens What question does each screen ask?

Make this conceptual distinction prominent.

RSD >10 / RSD >20

Does this replicate group have unusually large overall disagreement relative to
its own mean?

RSD is a relative, within-group statistic.

Dixon Q

Does one individual measurement appear unusually extreme relative to the other
measurements in this same replicate group?

Dixon is also within-group, but focuses on a single extreme value rather than
total group spread.

3× pooled within-replicate SD

Does an individual value deviate unusually far on an absolute scale relative to
the historical within-replicate precision observed for this analysis×parameter?

This is a cross-group, absolute-scale comparator.

Explicitly state that it is exploratory only, not a proposed production
threshold.

Screen applicability and review burden

Include a compact table:

| Screen | Flagged | % of all 2712 groups | Applicable groups | % of applicable
groups flagged |

Verify the current values.

Expected values to confirm include:

RSD >10: 407; 1955 applicable RSD >20: 177; same RSD-defined denominator Dixon:
246; 1447 applicable 3×SD: 51; 1966 applicable

Retain the applicability denominators. Raw flag counts are misleading without
knowing how many groups each screen could actually evaluate.

Agreement and disagreement among screens

Include enough overlap information to show that the screens are not redundant.

Preserve the useful RSD>20 × Dixon comparison if supported by the final files,
as well as the final combined flag-category breakdown where useful.

Explain:

Low overlap is expected because the screens answer different statistical
questions. It is not evidence that one method is “wrong.”

If space allows, retain tables showing parameters with the highest:

RSD>20 rates; Dixon flag rates; 3×SD flag rates.

These are useful because they demonstrate that different screens prioritize
different analysis×parameter combinations.

Connect the 3×SD limitation back to the relative/absolute analysis:

only a small number of combinations clearly behaved like approximately constant
absolute SD, providing limited empirical justification for a universal
absolute-SD screening model.

Flagged for further discussion: Which signal—or combination of signals—should
eventually trigger routine analyst review?

6. Review Backlog and Investigation Prioritization Size and composition of the
   review backlog

State the verified final result:

427 of 2712 replicate groups (15.7%) were flagged by at least one of:

RSD>20; Dixon; exploratory 3×SD.

Include the final flag-category breakdown where useful:

Dixon only; RSD only; 3×SD only; pairwise combinations; all three.

Explain what the distribution tells us about the different screening mechanisms.

Where flags are concentrated

Retain useful tables showing both counts and denominators.

Analysis × parameter

Include the top contributors and their within-combination flag rates.

Highlight the difference between cases such as:

XRF/Rb, Cu, Sr, U: high raw counts and high within-parameter flag rates;
proximate ash: substantial review contribution with only modest enrichment;
proximate volatile solids / total solids: meaningful queue contribution despite
below-baseline flag rates. Analysis type

Include:

| Analysis | Flagged groups | % of 427 | All replicate groups | Flag rate |

Explain that raw contribution and per-group propensity are different.

Other review dimensions

Include the final baseline/enrichment table covering important examples such as:

experiment 47; experiment 43; XRF; provider = rigging; knife mill (2mm); oven
dry + knife mill (2mm).

Explain:

% of flagged queue

= where analyst workload is concentrated.

Flag rate / enrichment vs baseline

= whether that category is flagged more often than expected given how much data
it contributes.

Maintain descriptive, non-causal wording.

Verify experiment 47's final figures and describe its rate as elevated relative
to baseline, not “similar.”

Do not state that experiment/provider/preparation method “causes” poor data.

Consolidating cases into investigations

Explain the provisional grouping key:

analysis_type + parameter + experiment_id

Include the grouping-key comparison:

| Grouping key | n packets | Median group size | Max group size | Singleton
packets | % singleton |

Include the existing alternatives:

base key; +resource_id; +provider; +sample preparation method;
+protocol_version; all metadata dimensions.

Explain the practical finding:

adding more metadata rapidly fragments the backlog into mostly singleton
packets, whereas the base grouping provides substantially more consolidation.

Explicitly preserve this limitation:

experiment_id is a convenient review grouping key. The available data do not
establish that it represents a specific common day/run/batch or a validated
shared root cause.

Review effort

Include a short planning table.

Verify the arithmetic from the final backlog before presenting it.

Do not reproduce stale approximate workload numbers if they conflict with the
final 427-case queue.

For any 5 / 10 / 15-minute scenarios:

label them hypothetical assumptions; distinguish individual flagged cases from
investigation packets; do not imply one packet requires the same time as one
individual case; do not claim that packet-count reduction produces an equivalent
labor reduction. Human-review priorities

Reuse the final Step 10 priority table:

| Priority | Review target | Grain | Flagged groups in target | Flag rate |
Enrichment vs baseline | Cumulative % of 427 flagged groups addressed | Why
review / suggested focus |

Verify all values against the final Step 10 files.

Explain that cumulative coverage uses the union of unique replicate-group IDs,
so overlapping review targets are not double-counted.

Highlight the practical finding:

a small number of coherent investigations can address most of the 427-group
backlog.

Retain useful sub-focuses for major experiment-level priorities, such as:

dominant XRF parameters within experiment 47; dominant ICP parameters within
experiment 43.

Do not imply these are validated common-root-cause clusters.

Flagged for further discussion: Is analysis_type + parameter + experiment_id
actually a useful investigation grain for the analysts who will conduct review?

Flagged for further discussion: What is a reasonable analyst review load? The
answer depends not only on case count but on how much friction the review
interface and documentation workflow create.

7. Implications for Analysts

Keep this section specific to what this exploratory analysis demonstrated.

Avoid generic recommendations such as “improve data quality” or “monitor
trends.”

Address:

Prioritize coherent investigations rather than reviewing randomly

The flagged queue is concentrated enough that analyst review can begin with a
small number of high-coverage experiment / analysis×parameter investigations.

Different flags imply different review questions high RSD → investigate large
overall replicate disagreement; Dixon → investigate a potentially isolated
extreme replicate; 3×SD → investigate unusual absolute deviation relative to
historical precision, while retaining its exploratory status. Flags need
contextual review

An analyst may need:

individual replicate values; source record IDs; existing QC status / notes;
experiment context; resource/sample context; relevant preparation/method
metadata.

Do not prescribe the final interface, but explain why the statistical flag alone
is insufficient.

Existing QC and statistical screening are complementary

Most statistically flagged groups are currently marked pass.

Clarify that:

this does not automatically imply existing QC was wrong; statistical screening
can identify forms of replicate disagreement not represented by the existing QC
field.

Mixed values such as fail,pass or pass,provisional represent mixed within-group
QC statuses, not standalone QC categories.

Investigation grain remains provisional

The current packet structure is useful analytically but has not yet been
validated with the people who will actually perform review.

Flagged for further discussion: Is the proposed investigation-packet grain
useful to analysts?

Flagged for further discussion: What information must be visible together in an
analyst-review interface to make disposition fast and credible?

Flagged for further discussion: What recurring review workload is operationally
acceptable?

8. Implications for Frontend Data Visualization

Keep frontend communication distinct from backend statistical QC.

Do not recommend displaying a statistical flag to users as “bad data.”

Explain how the findings could instead inform communication of:

expected precision; parameter-specific variability; evidence sufficiency;
methodological context.

Include a conceptual table:

Finding in analysis Possible frontend treatment Typical precision well
characterized Ordinary presentation; precision context/metadata if useful
Parameter shows elevated or long-tailed variability Parameter-specific
variability caveat Sparse replicate evidence Indicate limited precision evidence
rather than implying high precision Relevant methodological/preparation
differences Provide methodological context where useful Individual statistical
flag Backend review signal; do not automatically label as bad data

Ground the discussion in actual analysis findings.

XRF

XRF warrants substantial parameter-specific consideration, but do not imply that
every XRF measurement is equally problematic.

Emphasize particular parameters with elevated flag rates rather than a blanket
XRF warning.

ICP

Typical median precision may be reasonable while some parameters exhibit
important upper-tail variability.

Avoid representing ICP with one universal precision statement.

Proximate

Several major parameters may have strong typical repeatability while still
contributing flagged cases due partly to dataset size.

Avoid equating presence in the human-review queue with poor user-facing
reliability.

Compositional

Summarize actual typical precision and parameter-specific exceptions from the
findings.

Sparse evidence

For ultimate or other sparsely replicated measurements, distinguish:

“limited evidence about precision”

from

“high precision.”

Flagged for further discussion: Which precision/variability information is
useful to BioCirV users versus appropriate only for internal QC?

Flagged for further discussion: Should frontend caveats be defined at the
analysis level, analysis×parameter level, or only after analyst disposition of
individual cases?

Flagged for further discussion: How should insufficient replicate evidence be
represented so absence of evidence is not mistaken for evidence of high
precision?

9. Data Quality Due Diligence — Questions for Further Discussion

Keep this short.

Summarize what the Exploratory Outlier & Variance Analysis demonstrates:

BioCirV can quantify replicate precision at measurement-specific grains;
different statistical signals identify complementary review candidates; the
resulting review burden is measurable; the burden is concentrated enough to
prioritize coherent investigations; none of these statistical signals
independently proves an observation is erroneous.

End with:

Proposed Data Quality Due Diligence principle: BioCirV preserves raw
observations, screens analysis-ready data for predefined quality signals, and
uses flagged cases to prioritize documented human review. Statistical flags
initiate due diligence; they do not independently establish that a measurement
is erroneous or justify deletion.

Clearly label this as a proposed principle, not a claim that production
infrastructure already implements it.

Flagged for further discussion: What exactly should a BioCirV “Data Quality Due
Diligence Guarantee” promise?

Relevant unresolved decisions include:

which signals trigger review; what evidence analysts should inspect; what
constitutes sufficient disposition/documentation; what review burden is
acceptable; which findings stay backend-only versus become frontend context.

Do not attempt to settle these questions in this report.

10. Appendix: Supporting Tables and Figures

Be generous with existing supporting evidence.

Keep explanatory tables and figures in the main narrative when they materially
improve understanding.

Put exhaustive or secondary material in the appendix.

Strong appendix candidates include:

complete analysis×parameter precision table; extended column-definition table if
the main version is condensed; additional relative-vs-absolute diagnostic
figures; full candidate-screen overlap tables; top analysis×parameter lists for
each screen; extended backlog-by-dimension tables; supplementary grouping-key
tables; other existing figures from Steps 0–10 that materially support
conclusions.

Do not aggressively move figures into the appendix merely to shorten the report.

I will manually move additional figures and captions down later if the document
becomes too long.

Do not duplicate the same complete figure/table in both main text and appendix.
A condensed main table plus complete appendix table is fine.

When embedding existing figures, use valid relative Markdown paths and
descriptive captions.

Final quality-control pass

Before finishing:

Verify that every important numerical statement has a denominator/context where
needed. Verify terminology: provider, not lab; sample preparation method, not
analytical method. Verify no section outside the Methods overview unnecessarily
uses “Step X” as its conceptual heading. Check that precision, flag rate, raw
backlog contribution, and evidence sufficiency are not conflated. Check that
statistical flags are never described as proof of bad data. Verify all workload
arithmetic. Verify all Step 10 cumulative percentages against the actual final
output. Confirm existing figures/tables rather than inventing new ones. Confirm
no Steps 0–10 files were modified. Completion

Use attempt_completion to report:

path to the completed report; major numerical invariants verified; tables and
figures kept in the main narrative; tables and figures placed in the appendix;
all Flagged for further discussion and Flagged for further analysis callouts
included; any genuine unresolved inconsistencies found among the source files;
confirmation that Steps 0–10 were treated as frozen inputs and no existing
analysis files were modified; confirmation that the single overall report was
the only file created.

---

Meeting follow-up 9/1/2026: add frontend-oriented flag prevalence views to the
overall report. Do not change any flag logic or Steps 0–10.

The frontend developer said the most useful result is flagged data relative to
total data volume at analysis and analysis×parameter grain, not just share of
the 427-case queue.

Add/report for every analysis type: n_flagged_groups n_total_groups flag_rate =
n_flagged / n_total enrichment_vs_baseline = flag_rate / (427/2712) Add the same
table at analysis_type × parameter grain. Prefer including all
analysis×parameter combinations, including zero-flag combinations, by
joining/aggregating against the full replicate-group dataset rather than only
combinations present in flagged_review_queue.csv. Add the same descriptive
comparison at resource_type / feedstock grain: flagged total flag rate
enrichment vs baseline. Keep resource_id separate if individual resources are
also useful. For priority experiment_id investigations, make the entries
interpretable rather than displaying only experiment_id=47. Add structured
columns summarizing: experiment_id n flagged / n total flag rate enrichment
analyses represented main flagged parameters resource types resource_ids if
useful providers sample preparation methods

Do not imply experiment_id is a validated run/batch/root cause; retain the
existing caveat.

In the overall report, put the analysis and analysis×parameter prevalence tables
under Review Backlog and Investigation Prioritization → Flag prevalence by
analysis and parameter, and use them as the quantitative basis for Implications
for Frontend Data Visualization.

Preserve the distinction:

% of 427 flags = where review workload is concentrated flag rate = how
frequently data in that category are flagged enrichment vs baseline = how that
rate compares with the overall 15.7% rate.

This is descriptive aggregation of the already-established flags only; do not
create new QC rules or statistical analyses.
