Data portal materialized views package.

This package provides SQLAlchemy select() expressions for data portal materialized views.
Each view is defined in its own module for clarity and maintainability.

For backward compatibility, all views are re-exported here. Code that previously imported
from data_portal_views.py can continue to work unchanged:
