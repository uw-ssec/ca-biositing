# CA Biositing Data Models

SQLModel-based database models for the
[CA Biositing](https://github.com/sustainability-software-lab/ca-biositing)
project — a research platform for biomass feedstock siting in California.

This package provides 91 ORM models across 15 domain areas (resources, sampling,
analysis, infrastructure, external datasets), 7 materialized analytical views,
and Alembic-managed migrations backed by PostgreSQL with PostGIS.

from sqlmodel import Session, select
from ca_biositing.datamodels.database import get_engine
from ca_biositing.datamodels.models import Resource, FieldSample, Place

with Session(engine) as session:
    resources = session.exec(select(Resource)).all()
```
