# PostgreSQL Connection Settings
# ---
# This file serves as an example. Copy it to a new file named .env
# and replace the placeholder values with your actual development settings.

# 1. Individual Connection Parameters
# These are used by docker-compose to initialize the PostgreSQL container.
POSTGRES_USER=your_username
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_secret_password
POSTGRES_DB=your_db_name

# 2. Host Port Mapping
# This is the port on your local machine that will connect to the container's port 5432.
# If you have another PostgreSQL instance running locally, you may get a port conflict.
# In that case, change this to a different port, e.g., 5433.
POSTGRES_PORT=5432

# 3. Application Database URL
# This is the full connection string used by the Python application (e.g., SQLAlchemy, Alembic)
# to connect to the database container.
# Note:
#   - It uses the service name 'db' as the host, which is how containers talk to each other.
#   - It uses the internal port '5432', not the host port.
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://your_username:your_secret_password@db:5432/your_db_name
