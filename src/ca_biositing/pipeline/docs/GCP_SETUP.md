# Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Setup for Gspread

This guide explains how to set up a Google Cloud Platform project, create a
service account, and generate the `credentials.json` file required for this ETL
project to access Google Sheets.

---

### Overview

To allow our application to read data from a Google Sheet programmatically, we
need to:

1.  Create a **Service Account**, which is a special type of non-human user
    account.
2.  Enable the necessary APIs (Google Sheets and Google Drive).
3.  Generate a JSON key (`credentials.json`) that the application can use to
    authenticate as the service account.
4.  Share the target Google Sheet with the service account's email address.

### Step-by-Step Guide

**Step 1: Create or Select a GCP Project**

1.  Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2.  If you don't have a project, create one. If you do, select the project you
    want to use from the project dropdown at the top of the page.

**Step 2: Enable the Required APIs**

You need to enable the Google Sheets API and the Google Drive API for your
project.

1.  Navigate to the
    [API Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library).
2.  Search for "Google Sheets API" and click **Enable**.
3.  Search for "Google Drive API" and click **Enable**.

**Step 3: Create a Service Account**

1.  Navigate to the
    [Service Accounts page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)
    in the IAM & Admin section.
2.  Click **+ CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT**.
3.  Give the service account a name (e.g., `g-sheets-etl-runner`) and a
    description. The Service account ID will be generated automatically. Click
    **CREATE AND CONTINUE**.
4.  **Grant access (Optional but recommended):** In the "Grant this service
    account access to project" step, grant the "Viewer" role. This is not
    strictly necessary for Gsheets access but is a good practice. Click
    **CONTINUE**.
5.  **Grant user access (Optional):** You can skip this step. Click **DONE**.

**Step 4: Generate a JSON Key**

1.  You should now be back on the Service Accounts page. Find the service
    account you just created and click on its email address in the "Email"
    column.
2.  Go to the **KEYS** tab.
3.  Click **ADD KEY** -> **Create new key**.
4.  Select **JSON** as the key type and click **CREATE**.
5.  A JSON file will be automatically downloaded to your computer. **This is
    your `credentials.json` file.**

**Step 5: Place the Credentials File**

1.  Rename the downloaded file to `credentials.json`.
2.  Move this file into the project root directory. This file is listed in
    `.gitignore`, so it will not be committed to your repository.

**Step 6: Share the Google Sheet**

This is the final and most important step.

1.  Open the Google Sheet that you want the application to read.
2.  Find the service account's email address. You can either copy it from the
    "Email" column on the
    [Service Accounts page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)
    or find it inside your `credentials.json` file under the `"client_email"`
    key.
3.  In your Google Sheet, click the **Share** button in the top right corner.
4.  Paste the service account's email address into the "Add people and groups"
    field.
5.  Ensure the service account has at least **Viewer** permissions.
6.  Click **Send**.

Your setup is now complete. The application will be able to use the
`credentials.json` file to authenticate as the service account and read the data
from the shared Google Sheet.
