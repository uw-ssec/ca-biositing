## QGIS

This project includes QGIS for geospatial analysis and visualization. You can
run QGIS using pixi with the following command:

```bash
pixi run qgis
```

This will launch QGIS in the `gis` environment with all necessary dependencies
installed.

For MacOS, there will be a Python error about faulthandler, which is expected
and can be ignored, see https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/52987.
