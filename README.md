## Project Structure

This project uses a PEP 420 namespace package structure with the following components:

- **`ca_biositing.datamodels`**: Shared SQLModel database models
- **`ca_biositing.pipeline`**: ETL pipelines and Prefect workflows
- **`ca_biositing.api`**: FastAPI application

For details on the namespace package structure, see [NAMESPACE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](NAMESPACE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md).

please ask [Anshul Tambay](https://github.com/atambay37).

## QGIS

This project includes QGIS for geospatial analysis and visualization. You can
run QGIS using pixi with the following command:

```bash
pixi run qgis
```

This will launch QGIS in the `gis` environment with all necessary dependencies
installed.

For MacOS, there will be a Python error about faulthandler, which is expected
and can be ignored, see https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/52987.

## Frontend Integration

This repository now includes the **Cal Bioscape Frontend** as a Git submodule
located in the `frontend/` directory.

### Initializing the Submodule

When you first clone this repository, you can initialize and pull only the
`frontend` submodule with:

```bash
pixi run submodule-frontend-init
```
